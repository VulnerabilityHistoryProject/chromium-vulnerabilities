I want to eliminate that fake interface in favor of just having our code talk directly to ChromeClientImpl, but that means a dependency on webkit/glue, so I needed to use ChromiumBridge.  Long-term, I'd like to propose changes upstream to HostWindow and ChromeClient to avoid this usage of ChromiumBridge.\n\nThe most impactful part of this CL is the change to move the enumeration of cursor types from WebCursor to PlatformCursor.  This means that WebCursor consumers no longer have access to the type enumeration.  I replaced that with helper functions on WebCursor.

I simplified the logging code a bit so we don't need X_messages.cc files.Clean up places that we were doing manual packing/unpacking.  Most of this was in the automation code.  I added a few new template functions to make it convenient to read the parameters from a message, and updated the code to use them.I also removed unnecessary includes of render/plugin_messages.h from

09:41:39 -0400","message":"Mac: block ability to stat arbitrary files in the Sandbox.\n\nThis change removes the ability to stat any file on disk and instead only allows stating files to which we have read access.\n\nThe complication with removing the ability to stat an arbitrary path is that without extra work you get into a situation where you can stat a leaf directory, but not it's parent. e.g. stat(&quot/foo/bar&quot) succeeds while stat(&quot/foo&quot) fails with errno == EPERM.\n\nThe only place we currently run into this is the utility process where the file system is off limits except for one directory.\n\nThis causes problems in 2 places:\n1) DirectoryExists() works it's way from / down to the leaf directory stating each directory as it goes.\n2) The extension installation code calls realpath() which fails if it can't stat parent directories.\n\nThe fix for the above is to explictly allow stating parent directories.

without\nhaving to worry about conflicting with the singleton.\n\nThe teardown sequence of the AudioManager and its thread has been cleaned\nup significantly and I don't think it has been completely tested before as\nthe audio thread was terminated before all objects that belonged to the\nthread had a chance to do cleanup.  The AudioManager unit tests do not use\nthe actual audio thread, so this part seems to have been left out.\n\nIn Chrome, the AudioManager instance is now owned by BrowserProcessImpl\nand always constructed on the UI thread.  This instance is then shared\nin the same way that several other 'manager' type objects are shared to\n'content' code, via content::ResourceContext.  Audio specific classes\ndo though receive a direct pointer to the AudioManager and are required\nto do proper reference counting if they need to hold onto the instance.\nI chose to use the ResourceContext rather than direct use of g_browser_process\nto avoid requiring another singleton when writing relatively simple tests\nthat touch the AudioManager.\n\nI added a couple of safeguards to guard against future regressions:\n- Not more than one instance of the AudioManager should be created.\n- The AudioManager should not be addrefed by its own thread.  This\n  can basically become a circular reference and prevent deterministic\n  shutdown.\n\nReviewers:  Of course you're free to review everything,\nbut here's the breakdown in terms of the bare minimum from\nthe standpoint of &quotOwners approval&quot.  I'm asking Henrik to be the\nmain reviewer of the entire patch (sorry!).\n\nHenrik: Everything minus the below, but it would be great if you could\n        take a look at the whole thing, specifically media/audio.\n\nPawel:  I'd like you to take a generic look at this approach.\n        The key areas as far as the singleton itself goes are in\n

This\nenables WebKit to pass the IE Chalkboard demo in 10s on a Z620:\nhttp://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Performance/Chalkboard/\n\nOn a simple scaled SVG benchmark similar to the IE10 Chalkboard demo\n(http://philbit.com/SvgImagePerformance/viewport.html):\n    without patch: ~20FPS\n    with patch: ~55FPS\n\nThe bitmap SVG image cache had several shortcomings:\n    - The bitmap cache prevented viewport rendering. (WK104693)\n    - Bitmap memory usage was high. (WK106484)\n    - Caching animating images was expensive.\n\nThis change removes almost all of the SVGImageCache implementation, replacing it with\ndirectly-rendered SVG. Instead of caching bitmaps, an SVGImageForContainer is cached which\nis a thin wrapper around an SVG image with the associated container size and scale.\nWhen rendering patterns (e.g., tiled backgrounds), a temporary bitmap is used for\nperformance. This change also removes the redraw timer of the old cache, instead relying\non the SVG image to notify clients if the image changes (e.g., during animations).\n\nThis patch fixes two existing bugs (WK99481 and WK104189) that were due to caching bitmaps\nat a fixed size. A test has been added for each of these bugs.\n\nTests: svg/as-image/svg-image-scaled.html\n       svg/as-image/svg-image-viewbox.html\n\n* CMakeLists.txt:\n* GNUmakefile.list.am:\n* Target.pri:\n* WebCore.gypi:\n* WebCore.vcproj/WebCore.vcproj:\n* WebCore.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:\n* loader/cache/CachedImage.cpp:\n(WebCore::CachedImage::lookupOrCreateImageForRenderer):\n(WebCore::CachedImage::setContainerSizeForRenderer):\n(WebCore::CachedImage::clear):\n(WebCore::CachedImage::changedInRect):\n\n    SVG images are no longer special-cased here.

calling the method\nResourceProvider::PrepareSendReturnsToChild(). This is problematic\nbecause we want to return resources immediately if the last reference\non the resource is released when a parent compositor gives the resource\nback to us.\n\nTextureMailboxes deal with this gracefully by using a ReleaseCallback\nin the ResourceProvider that is called when the mailbox is no longer in\nuse. We follow this example to release resources back to child\ncompositors by introducing a ReturnCallback in the ResourceProvider.\nThe ReturnCallback receives an array of resources instead of a single\nresource per call, allowing us to save on post tasks and Run()\ninvocations.\n\nThe PrepareSendReturnsToChild is completely replaced by the new callback\nmechanism. Resources are returned when they are no longer in use in the\ncurrent frame, and their exported reference count reaches zero (or lost\nif the child compositor's connection is destroyed).\n\nWhen the DelegatedRendererLayerImpl recieves a new frame, it will always\nadd all the resources into the ResourceProvider so that it can map the\nresource ids correctly into its own compositor's namespace. Then it will\ndecide if the frame is valid or not. At that point, the DRLI must decide\nto use the new frame, or continue using the old frame. It does this by\ncalling DeclareUsedResourcesFromChild() on the provider. Any resource\nnot listed in the declaration will become unused and returned to the\nchild as soon as possible. This changes the contract on ResourceProvider\nsuch that every call to ReceiveFromChild() should be followed by a\nDeclareUsedResourcesFromChild() call.\n\nFor now, DelegatedRendererLayer receives the callbacks about returned\nresources and just inserts them in its list of resources for the\nembedder to grab via TakeUnusedResourcesForChildCompositor().

An event listener must be fired in a ScriptState that is calculated based on the ExecutionContext that fired the event listener and the world that installed the event listener. This is what we had been doing before r175241, and this CL restores the behavior. See an added test case for more details. The new behavior aligns with the spec and Firefox.\n\nOne tricky part is how to handle a beforeunload event. A return value of a beforeunload event needs to be fired in a ScriptState that installed the beforeunload event listener. To achieve the behavior, this CL records the ScriptState onto V8AbstractEventListener::m_scriptStateForBeforeUnload.\n\nBUG=422227\nTEST=event-should-be-dispatched-for-correct-frame.html,before-unload-return-bad-value.html\n\nReview URL:

uses the ScriptState in a lot of places about event listeners and cleans up the code (for example, this CL removes an empty creation context from toV8()).\n\n- The complicated part is that V8LazyEventListener does not know the ScriptState when it's created. Thus, V8AbstractEventListener::m_scriptState can be null if the listener is a V8LazyEventListener until the V8LazyEventListener is called back from Blink (i.e., either of handleEvent(), callListenerFunction() and getEventListener() is called).\n\n- This CL changes web-exposed behavior. In a case where the frame that registered an onload event handler (say Frame1) is different from the frame that triggers the onload event (Frame2), before this CL, the onload event handler is invoked in the context of Frame2. After this CL, the onload event handler is not triggered if Frame1 != Frame2. This behavior is not speced but aligns with Firefox.

This initial implementation is close in\nappearance to the legacy display of alt-text but will ultimately move closer to\nthe one seen in Firefox and described in http://hixie.ch/specs/alttext.\n\nThe alt-text and broken-image icon is now rendered as:\n\n    <style>\n        #alttext-container {\n        overflow: hidden;\n        border: 1px solid silver;\n        padding: 1px;          \n        display: inline-block;        \n        }                                 \n        #alttext { display: none; overflow: hidden;}\n    </style>                                    \n    <div id=&quotalttext-container&quot>                  \n        <img src=&quotdata:png, [broken-image-icon]&quot width=&quot16&quot height=&quot16&quot align=&quotleft&quot style=&quotmargin: 0px&quot>\n        <div id=&quotalt-text&quot>Alt text in here</div>         \n    </div>                                                  \n\nSome notes on the way the fallback content is now rendered: \n\n    - The fallback content is rendered inside an inline-block so it does not calculate \n      its dimensions the way a replaced element (i.e. an image) would (as defined by\n      http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html#inline-replaced-width). So where one of width \n      or height is auto but the other is not, the fallback content will not exactly match \n      the dimensions calculated by RenderImage in error mode currently.

these tests do things backwards: they first initialize Blink and then create a message loop. This means we can't create a real scheduler for Blink and have to jump through hoops to make things work. We could extend this mock scheduler to properly clean things up, but I think I'll instead try to get rid of the mock scheduler completely.\n\nOriginal issue's description:\n> Implement timers by

It should not be used internally for generating random numbers in Blink.\n\nThe way cryptographically random number generation worked in Blink prior to this patch is that wtf::cryptographicallyRandomValues() would generate random bytes using an ARC4 keystream. Every 1.6MB of generated data it would stir in randomness obtained via Platform::current()->cryptographicallyRandomValues().\n\nThe way it works after this patchset is that wtf::cryptographicallyRandomValues() directly calls Platform::current()->cryptographicallyRandomValues(), without layering on its own PRNG. The concrete implementation of Platform::cryptographicallyRandomValues() now calls crypto::RandBytes() [1], which provides good cryptographically secure random numbers by reading from hardware/system randomness sources.\n\nThe consequences of this change are:\n\n * The fixed sequence of random numbers seen by certain tests will have changed. I haven't observed this to be a problem with any of the tests though.\n\n * The performance characteristics of cryptographicallyRandomValues() have changed, for the worse. Measured using a microbenchmark, window.crypto.getRandomValues() is almost 5x slower now. This is not all that surprising since RC4 was pretty fast, and was only mixing in system randomness every 1.6MB (my test generated 256MB).\n\n[1] Technically it is calling base::RandBytes(), but under the hood that calls crypto::RandBytes(). Will fix that dependency separately.\n\nBUG=552749\n\nReview URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/1431233002\n\nCr-Commit-Position:

However, this lead\nto reports of incorrect integrity failures in the presence of resources\nwith various Unicode characters. It turned out that these characters,\nwhen normalized, gave a different byte output than the raw data had,\nthus leading to incorrect failures.\n\nTo address this, the SRI checks are rewritten here to use raw bytes\nrather than strings. While this might sound straightforward, it's a bit\nmore complicated because ScriptResource objects do not keep the raw data\naround after the source is accessed once, so if the resource is accessed\nfrom the MemoryCache for a second time, there is no way to redo the SRI\ncheck.\n\nThus, this implements a scheme where we cache the integrity information\nfor a ScriptResource after the first time it is checked, and if there is\nanother request for that resource, with the same integrity metadata, we\nskip the integrity calculation. However, if the integrity metadata is a\nmismatch, we skip the MemoryCache and rerequest the resource.

This\npatch changes our behavior to throw an exception.\n\nFirefox currently does not throw an exception, but silently denies\naccess to set the property cross-origin. I don't believe that's behavior\nwe should seek to replicate.\n\nThis patch removes the one-off\n'BindingSecurity::allowSettingFrameSrcToJavascriptUrl', moving the guts of\nthe protocol check into the custom bindings, and delegating the security\naspects to 'allowAccessToFrame'. 'allowAccessToFrame' can now accept an\n'ExceptionState' rather than a reporting enum, and that's piped through\nto a new 'canAccessDocument' method. This has the happy effect of\nbeginning to put the pieces in place for future patches which will\nmigrate other 'allowAccessToFrame' calls to the new, exception-throwing\nmodel.\n\nThe patch also adds 'ExceptionState::throwSecurityError', which\naccepts two strings: a sanitized string, and an unsanitized optional\nstring. Those values get piped through V8ThrowException, and are stored\non 'DOMException' which tunnels through V8 and pops out in\n'V8Initializer'. There, I set the unsanitized message on the 'ErrorEvent'\nobject that's handed off to the exception reporting code in\n'ScriptExecutionContext'.\n\nThis is a re-land of [1]; the only difference is the 'V8DOMWrapper'\ncheck in 'V8Initializer'.\n\nBUG=17325\nTBR=arv@chromium.org, abarth@chromium.org\n\n[1]: https://codereview.chromium.org/22829002\n\nReview URL: https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/22985006\n\ngit-svn-id: svn://svn.chromium.org/blink/trunk@156200 bbb929c8-8fbe-4397-9dbb-9b2b20218538","insertions":66,"deletions":233,"churn":299,"filepaths":{"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/javascriptURL/javascriptURL-execution-context-frame-location-htmldom-expected.txt":{"insertions":3,"deletions":6},"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/javascriptURL/javascriptURL-execution-context-frame-location-htmldom-uncaught-expected.txt":{"insertions":0,"deletions":13},"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/javascriptURL/javascriptURL-execution-context-frame-location-htmldom-uncaught.html":{"insertions":0,"deletions":39},"third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/http/tests/security/javascriptURL/javascriptURL-execution-context-frame-location-htmldom.html":{"insertions":28,"deletions":27},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/BindingSecurity.cpp":{"insertions":10,"deletions":27},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/BindingSecurity.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/ExceptionState.cpp":{"insertions":0,"deletions":12},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/ExceptionState.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/ExceptionStatePlaceholder.cpp":{"insertions":0,"deletions":5},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/ExceptionStatePlaceholder.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/V8Initializer.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":12},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/V8ThrowException.cpp":{"insertions":5,"deletions":8},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/V8ThrowException.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":10},"third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/v8/custom/V8HTMLFrameElementCustom.cpp":{"insertions":1,"deletions":6},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/DOMException.cpp":{"insertions":4,"deletions":11},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/DOMException.h":{"insertions":4,"deletions":10},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/ErrorEvent.cpp":{"insertions":2,"deletions":8},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/ErrorEvent.h":{"insertions":2,"deletions":9},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/ScriptExecutionContext.cpp":{"insertions":2,"deletions":2},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/page/DOMWindow.cpp":{"insertions":0,"deletions":21},"third_party/WebKit/Source/core/page/DOMWindow.h":{"insertions":0,"deletions":1}}},"464f41055aeb070a55ec30682f8768bd8e88b4e6":{"commit":"464f41055aeb070a55ec30682f8768bd8e88b4e6","author":"jww@chromium.org","email":"jww@chromium.org","date":"2015-06-16 17:08:46 -0400","message":"Add window access checks for Suborigins\n\nAs a first enforcement step, this adds access control checks for windows\nand JavaScript objects for Suborigins.
