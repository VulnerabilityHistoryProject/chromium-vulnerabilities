CVE: CVE-2011-3884
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 401
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  A timing issues in the DOM traversal can cause denial of service attacks and
  remote vector issues or possible unknown issuess through a crafted document.

  The DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a tree like structure, used to
  represent the HTML webpage.

  The DOM traversal runs for at most 50ms before pausing to allow the WebkKit 
  thread to run. If the frame is removed before the traversal resumes then it
  will attempt to access a deleted WebFrame.

  The fix is to ensure that the WebDocument is not null.

  An interesting note is that these vulnerabilities are in a client side phishing
  detection model.

  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:

  :note: |
    Since the is a time limit on how long the detector can run 
    it is not guaranteed that the WebFrame will exist. The fix was
    to cache the WebDocument pointer instead of the WebFrame and
    check if it is ever null. 
vccs:
- commit: 29f55a47219cf6f5f6064a50395cbdc25dc493ad
  note: |
    This commit tracks how long the detector has been working. If 
    it is working too long then it will allow other task to run.
    Then there is a total time. If the task takes more than that 
    time limit the detector will give up. They never take into account
    the WebFrame not being availiable leading to this vulnerability.
upvotes_instructions: |
  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There are tests in this part of the code, but the discovery of this bug was
    not found through unit testing.

    A new test was writen to prevent this bug and security vulnerability again. 
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Crashed appearing on all platforms.

    Found by Brian Ryner of the Chromium development community.
  date: 2011-09-19
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    This is located in the renderer component of the chrome system. SafeBrowsing
    is located in the renderer directory.
  name: SafeBrowsing
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 2037b0104b00698046fbcfcbb783f9c6e2a016f0
    note: |
      This commit reduces the total time the dectector is allowed to
      run even more, giving even more chance for this vulnerability to
      occur.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: There appears to be no major changes during this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      They didn't consider if an object would(n't) be available ater considering

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The developers did not consider all the consequences for adding a time out.
    It appears they were attempting to make the process quicker, since they even
    reduced the limit one time. 

    Managing resources is an important part of security. Since you can not allways be
    sure that a resource or object will be available. Check for edge cases and attempt
    to prevent the possibility of freed resources being accessed.
