description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the whitelist of
  acceptable plugins. The whitelist is part of the host-based settings. The 
  whitelist works as intended when navigating, because all webpages will have a
  host. The issue is when a new tab is first created, there is no host and thus
  the plugin whitelist will not be applied.  

  The fix for this vulnerability was having new windows inherit host-based settings
  from the parent.

fixes:
- :commit: 62d2a1159508500bd079f41f2169d8460566c342
  :note: |
    The fix involved defaulting the content settings to the parent window.
    This will indirectly pass the host-based settings to the new window.

  :note: |
    This commit was responsible for applying the host content settings 
    when navigating to a new url. It did not account for applying content
    settings to new windows.

  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered by a developer and reported to the team. The
    vulnerability was shown with a simple script that opened a new window and embeded a
    plugin.

  contest:
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    This was in the browser subsystem. This is because it is within the chrome directory.
  name: browser
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
  - commit: d8fd6faa7cdccb77c2d496e1ebb9d5f1b9ede717
    note: |
      This commit involves giving plugins current window activation information.
  - commit: 0de8016abb321cb9a1c32dfb534cf16ec905b260
    note: |
      This commit involves notifying the browser when content get blocked. This 
      relates to the vulnerability which also involved blocking content.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    It appears that at the time the vulnerability was created, the team was focused
    on updating chrome for the new OS X operating system for mac computers. Even
    though the vulnerability was introduced while updating for OS X, the
    vulnerability is for all operating systems.
  events:
  - name: Allowing GPU processing on OS X Mac computers.
    date: 2010-2-3
  - name: Added 3D support to Mac Leopard operating system
    date: 2010-2-23
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I think a few mistakes went into the creation of the vulnerability. First
    of all, I believe there may have been miscommunication within the team. 
    When reading the thread detailing the vulnerability, there seemed to be 
    disagreement on whether this was a UI decision. It's possible that when
    the vulnerability was first introduced, the programmer considered it a 
    UI design decision. This can also lead to it being a mistake in the
    requirements. It's very possible that the default blocking of plugins
    was not a requirement. This also could be the result of the programmer 
    not understanding the system as a whole. If the programmer did not completely
    understand how the creation of a new window works, this vulnerability would
    have gone unnoticed. Going forward, vulnerabilities like this can be avoided
    with a couple steps. First, teammates always need to be on the same page when it
    comes to requirements. Next, if something is unclear in the requirements,
    developers should review it with the team. Finally, developers should also make
    sure that they understand the system they are working in completely before making
    changes.
