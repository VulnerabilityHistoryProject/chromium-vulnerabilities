  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  When decoding a video, a buffer is allocated for each frame to be decoded in
  to. However, if the buffer is not large enough to hold the decoded frame, a
  heap overflow occurs, which can allow data to be written where it should not.

  This Heap-based buffer overflow inside the function to get a video buffer for 
  decoding allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by causing the
  system to crash. An exploited to abuse this could be a malicious video file
  embedded on a web page.

    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    Looking at the fix commit, there were test cases for the code, but a new
    case was created to test the specific vulnerability.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Found using ClusterFuzz (Inferno_flicker), then questionably reported as fixed 
    by the same fuzzer. Engineers were unable to reproduce the issue using ffmpeg
    seperately so the search was narrowed until they found the buffer allocation
    that caused the issue. They then fixed the vulnerability by replicating how 
    ffmpeg allocates the buffer.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: de90333e4f90bc8f35b74b0cc1433afd434eb93a
    note: |
      This commit adds verification to the video size before allocating the
      frame, and changed only 2 lines of code. This may have prevented some
      cases of the vulnerability being used, but not all cases.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The coding error was a buffer overflow, caused by not allocating enough 
    space for ffmpeg to use for decoding. This mistake was because the buffer
    provided by chrome did not use the same calculations for allocating space
    as a buffer that would be provided by ffmpeg.

    This vulnerability was caused by misunderstanding how ffmpeg allocates and
    handles video buffers. The team changed the code so Chorme provides a
    buffer for ffmpeg to use instead of letting ffmpeg allocate a buffer, but
    they used a slightly different calculation to determine the size of the
    buffer. 

    The solution implemented was to allocate the same ammount of space as
    ffpeg would have for the buffer, ensuring that there was enough room to 
    not overflow the buffer.
