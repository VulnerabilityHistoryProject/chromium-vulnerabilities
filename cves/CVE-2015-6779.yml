CVE: CVE-2015-6779
CWE: 264
announced: 2015-12-05 20:59:16.663000000 -05:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  The issue with this CVE entry is that when a user opens a pdf file in the
  chrome pdf-viewer, and the pdf file has a link to a url, they can open this
  link in a new tab. This is prohibited in HTML. This also should not even be
  possible in a pdf file.

    Two year old known bug, commits were made after that and it is
    unknown why changes were not made. They were trying to fix the context menu
    on pdf files in the dev tool emulator.
upvotes_instructions: |
  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    From looking over the code and the way the fix was discovered it does not
    look like there was any type of automated testing. It was a pretty finite
    fix and it doesn't appear as if any was needed, besides checking it by
    hand.
  code: false
  fix:  false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    The exploit was found by ullrich....@gmail.com. It was found and reproduced
    by hand. The exploit was easy, as all that had to be done was navigate to a
    pdf file with a link in it, so the urgency/importance was quickly raised to
    high.
  date: 9/4/15
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest:
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on the directory and path of the problem code
  name: browser
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 1ce1597337ec9459598cc84a6bc3831c2ea3dfac
    note: This commit split a class into base and Chrome implementations. This
      redeligation of responsibilities is probably where the root/cause of the
      bug was created, if this wasn't where the bug itself was introduced.
  - commit: 6ae04a013f6040f5d38e6cf04f6da224f21b77f9
    note: This commit took out a big chunk of code and it is the second time
      this commit was made, as the first one was reverted for causing a bug. The
      commit in general smells and I can see issues being raised here.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    I did not see any major events, this was more or less an unfortunate bug.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      The common user has access to do something that they should not, and

      One of the inital attempts to fix this bug was essentually security by
      obscurity. They just went over the pdf and made the links plaintext so
      users wouldn't click on them, but the error and flaw was still present.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I would say that this mistake was more unfortunate then anything else. If I
    had to choose a way to categorize this, or even call it a mistake, I would
    have to say maintainability. But I do not want to even call it that. Here
    is why.

    This mistake should not have happened. It is prohibited in HTML, and it
    isn't in the nature of PDF documents to allow this behavior. Somewhere
    along the way, I am guessing some code got implemented that made this
    happen. So I will call it maintainability. but at the end of the day,
    nobody would think to plan or block for this. It was just all around
    unlucky and unfortunate that this happened.
