CVE: CVE-2015-1296
CWE: 20

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description:
    You could place special unicode characters in the URL so that a padlock
    character would be displayed at the beginning of the URL which could fool
    the user into thinking that they had a secure connection over HTTPS.
    Attackers could post links anywhere on the web that include these special
    characters so when people click on them and see the padlock icon they'd
    think that they're safe. The padlock icon verifies that the server is in
    fact who they claim to be. If you go on Facebook.com and see the padlock
    then it verifies that there isn't a third party impersonating Facebook.
    They could hide them with a hyperlink so that the characters don't appear 
    in the link visible to the user, but when they click on it the web browser 
    would copy it to the omnibox and display the padlock character. The
    omnibox is the address bar in chrome, they just call in the omnibox 
    internally.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: true
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    It was reported by zcorpan and he received a reward of $1000 for finding
    the bug. He also was put in the chrome release notes for finding it. It does
    say though that if he disclosed the bug information before it was fixed then
    he wouldn't get the money anymore. It doesn't say how zorcpan found the bug.
    All of this information was obtained from the bug report on chromium.org. 
    Also, there isn't really a commit that introduced the vulnerability. It has 
    been around since the beginning of the project, as long as they had the 
    OmniBox and the SSL padlock icon this was an issue.
  date: 2014-10-08
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    It affected the omnibox but the issue was in the core of the system, in
    netloc/core/
  name: OmniBox
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 2cd905494ba700a8e2097d614ed39ad36d1519f2
    note: |
        Here they added more unicode characters to be escaped in URLs, like
        U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING and a few others. Also, the unicode spec
        was updated so they added exceptions for the new bidrectional
        characters.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    There weren't really any major events around this. They had a few issues
    with unicode and with the omnibox but neither of them got major rehauls
    around the time of this vulnerability.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

        There are complex unicode inputs with special charcters in RTL mode

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This issue happened at the Requirements phase. They should have considered
    all of the complex unicode inputs that people could use to attempt to spoof
    URLs. In order for this type of vulnerability to be caught they would have 
    needed to have someone who is very familiar with unicode to be on the team.
    This person would have to know about the padlock character and know that 
    there are RTL characters that can be used to move characters to appear at
    the beginning of the string. Throughout all of development no one must have
    thought of an attack like this. It's a really complex input so it's 
    understandable that they never considered it originally though. They couldn't
    remove all unicode characters though because people who speak languages who's
    alphabet doesn't fit in ASCII need to be able to search for things with the
    omnibox.
