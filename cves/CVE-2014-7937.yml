CVE: CVE-2014-7937
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 119
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everythicwng out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2015-01-22 17:59:18.380000000 -05:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Multiple off-by-one errors in libavcodec/vorbisdec.c resulting for-loop over/under-execution.
  The vorbisdec.c is a decodeder for vorbis data. Vorbis is an open-source project that
  produces audio coding for lossy audio. These error allows for possible denial of
  service attacks. Other vulnerabilities such as information disclosure and unauthorized
  modification may also exist, with the crafting of vorbis data.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: true
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    ClusterFuzz, a google produced fuzzer, verified and reported on the
    bug.
  date: 2014-09-30
  automated: true
  google: true
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    Audio and video conversion tool called FFmpeg that is built into chrome.
    (chromium/chromium/third_party/ffmpeg)
  name: FFmpeg
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: c727401aa9d62335e89d118a5b4e202edf39d905 (Within ffmpeg)
    note: (Within FFmpeg) Commit message states "Fixes out of array access". Out of index loops
      were an issue they were dealing a lot with around this time.
  - commit: (Within FFmpeg) 075a165d2715837d125a9cc714fb430ccf6c9d6b (Within ffmpeg)
    note: Commit message states "This avoids out of array accesses". Again,
      another instance of dealing with loops going out of index.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The past three commits to the fix were all affecting this file. There
    also appeared to be a good number of commits fixing off-by-one errors
    throughout the project.
  events:
    - name: \"try to workaround libvorbisenc bug\" - working with bugs in the file
      date: 04/29/2014
    - name: \"Reset first_frame\" - issues around code
      date: 06/06/2014
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      Crafted Vorbis I data could be put into the code causing 'other impacts', data should scrubbed/escaped.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This error was cause by a simple coding mistake, an off-by-one error. Theses mistakes are bound to happen,
    the only thing that can prevents error like this are extensive tests that include boundary and edge
    cases. The mitigation is very simple and does look proper. An off-by-one is quite easy to identify
    and correct. This was fixed according to the CWE, as the fix is making sure loops stay within range, when
    working in languages like C.
