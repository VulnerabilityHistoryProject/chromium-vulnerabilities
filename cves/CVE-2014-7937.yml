  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    This bug was discovered by someone outside of the dev team, but ClusterFuzz, a google
    made fuzzer verified and retested the issue. The fuzzer
    itself reported the bug on the chromium bugs page. Google does not provide
    info as to if the orginal code was unit tested. The fix did not involve
    improving automated tests. However, an employee at ffmpeg discovered this
    before its original discovery within chrome.
  code: |
    The error stemmed from an off by one error. To correct this, instead of using
    a member value of 'vr' 'ptns_to_read', they used a passed parameter called
    'ptns_to_read' ('ptns_to_read' instead of 'vr->ptns_to_read'). This variable was
    use used within an if statement within a for loop. The incorrect value caused
    the if statement to execute when it should not have. This extra execution of the
    condition opened the door for several vulnerabilities.
  fix: |
    The fix involved the use of 'ptns_to_read' instead of 'vr->ptns_to_read'. This
    corrected an off by one error, preventing the vulnerability.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    ClusterFuzz, a google produced fuzzer, verified and reported on the
    bug.
  date: 2014-09-30
  automated: true
  google: yes
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    Audio and video conversion tool called FFmpeg that is built into chrome.
    (chromium/chromium/third_party/ffmpeg)
  name: FFmpeg
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: c727401aa9d62335e89d118a5b4e202edf39d905 (Within ffmpeg)
    note: Commit message states "Fixes out of array access". Out of index loops
      were an issue they were dealing a lot with around this time.
  - commit: 075a165d2715837d125a9cc714fb430ccf6c9d6b (Within ffmpeg)
    note: Commit message states "This avoids out of array accesses". Again,
      another instance of dealing with loops going out of index.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    From the commit that contained to the original function, to the fix, the
    fucntion is nearly identical. It just took time for the bug to come into
    the light. The previous four commits to the fix were all in the same file.
    It is most likely someone was working with the file within FFmpeg and discovered
    the vulnerability via testing.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This error was cause by a simple coding mistake, an off-by-one error. Theses mistakes are bound to happen,
    the only thing that can prevents error like this are extensive tests that include boundary and edge
    cases. The mitigation is very simple and does look proper. An off-by-one is quite easy to identify
    and correct. This was fixed according to the CWE, as the fix is making sure loops stay within range, when
    working in languages like C.
