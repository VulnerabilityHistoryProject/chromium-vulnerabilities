CVE: CVE-2013-6646
CWE: 
announced: 2014-01-16 07:17:26.437000000 -05:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The implementation of a database observer causes Chrome to crash due to an invalid
  pointer error when multiple databases are opened in the observer at once due to a
  script continuously reloading from the multiple shared worker methods (scripts)
  created by the multiple databases. Specifically, a variable is being passed into the
  observer after the worker's thread has already ended. This opens up a User After Free
  (UAF) vulnerability, a type of memory corruption bug that, in this case, opens up the
  possibility for malicious users to cause a denial of service attack by shutting down
  the worker processes related to the worker methods.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    As far as I have been able to determine, there were no unit tests utilized
    before the vulnerability was discovered, none implemented after they were
    discovered, and no existing ones that were edited after the fix was implemented.
  code: false
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    The vulenrability was reported by a normal user (using a normal @gmail.com email
    address) so it is a bit hard to determine how it was initially discovered. On top
    of this, the method of reproduction involves running a given script.
    
    It was stated, however, that issue 303154, a similar issue to 249502, was found
    through automation. While this might at first seem like 249502 was found through
    similar means, the developers then state that it found done through directly
    running into the User After Free error, suggesting they did not find it through
    automation.

  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: The shared workers subsystem for Chromium.
  name: shared_worker
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 643255da9818f8c8d072eda997fa5268d40c1c6e
    note: |
      This commit introduced experimental webkit features to shared workers. What's
      notable about this is that this was committed on the day that the vulnerability
      was found.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I did see an interesting event during this timeframe.
  events:
  - name: Issue 303154 was discovered, showing many similarities to the main issue being looked at here, 249502.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      The vulnerability in question could allow for shutting down a worker process remotely,
      something that could cause a wide variety of attacks from denial of service to
      repudiation attacks by not allowing a worker to confirm a worker process.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Although most crashes can be attributed to questionable coding practices,
    this one was ultimately caused by what I believe to be a design mistake:
    allowing multiple shared worker events to occur simultaneously without
    understanding the potential problems that could present. The fact that not
    one, but two issues came up involving UAF vulnerabilities regarding shared
    workers showed they overlooked elements of their design. This is corroborated
    by the fact that one of the developers didn't realize that the bug was
    occurring at the process exit, causing them to think the priority of the bug
    should have been lower than it realistically was. There's even a point where
    a "class of worker bugs" is mentioned, implying it could have been even larger
    than just these two issues.
    With that said, the fix does seem to be proper as the developers have fixed
    the core issue which was understanding when the proper point to kill a 
    worker process was.
