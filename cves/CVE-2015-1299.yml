description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There was an issue with timers being removed and the reference to the timer being used.
  Timers were set up so that they lived in a heap. The problem with this is there
  was logic that ended up freeing/removing a timer, due to a bad conditional. This conditional
  attempted to compare an 80-bit integer with a 64-bit integer. This would cause
  the program to update the heap and make a duplicate timer. Eventually, the timer would
  be deleted but the 'duplicate' (which is a pointer to the original) would be used.

  The fix was a complete overhaul of the timer file. Remove all references of a heap
  to use a more reliable scheduler.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer:
    Unfortunately, unit tests were not involved in finding this vulnerability. Furthermore,
    there are good signs to suggest there were not unit tests present before the fix. This is because
    the file of unit tests did not exist as of the time before the fix. Fortunately, the fix did have some
    unit tests added in within commit 645556929e1aad3f51f70d47a449998f4f7f1913 that added TimerTests.cpp.
  code: false
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer:
    This was discovered by someone who had crashed a tab and went to another site
    and had it report a crash (when it should not have). They reported it in the Chromium
    bugs forum.
  date: 2014-09-22
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest:
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer:
    The mistake was found in the Blink Subsystem (currently within WebKit).
  name: Blink Timer

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    When the issue was captured, there was not too many people working on the project.
    That means the issue took a long time to complete.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The vulnerability was a complex issue that never really led to a defined solution. It
    started with the fact they made the decision to create a heap and use that for a scheduler.
    This is an issue because it was not needed and added a good amount of complexity which makes
    security more difficult. In addition, it was in a relatively unpopular area with only a few people
    being familiar with the section. This allowed for the bug to exist for quite sometime after it was first found.
    The next issue was the fact there were no unit tests until AFTER the solution was found. This allowed
    for plenty of findable mistakes to pass through (as many as three). Lastly the way they came about a solution
    was very problematic. It looked like from the git history they did not properly test their solution in the
    system. as a whole. so it led to four reverts. This could stem from the fact that instead of investigating
    for the specific solution, they just wiped the entire subsystem.
