description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
Key-paths are a way of storing uninvoked references to properties. In easier terms,
they refer to a property itself rather than to that property’s value. 

The vulnerability was in Google's Javascript Engine, *V8*, in an API 
implementation written in C. Getters using key-paths were
not restricted to inherited properties, allowing getters on prototypes
to be executed. 

This created a use-after-free vulnerability. Use After Free specifically refers to the 
attempt to access memory after it has been freed, which can cause a program to crash
in the best case, or can potentially result in the execution of 
arbitrary code or even enable full remote code execution capabilities.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
  In the VCC it states, "The bindings tests show us that the generated bindings are what we expect."
  While there were unit tests performed, they likely did not test for the specific vulnerability exploits.
  Almost ever commit that is dedicated to fixing this bug improved the automated tests.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Based on the description in the CVE and path to source file.
  name: v8
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
  - commit: c65e88c084b14e6478d74781096e9d91a73c6f0e
    note: |
    Lots of logic was removed and added to the file. 
    Added 163 lines of edge case testing for our vulnerability, clearly these edge cases had been missed and
    both the functional code and the testing were introduced in this commit.
    It was interesting to see even in such large scale productions, effective unit tests that cover all edge cases are
    difficult to create yet extremely important. 
  - :commit: eb8adaaf4f33fc4f6eb4d9d612916ac5d4f32075
  :note: |
  Logic pertaining to null pointers was added. This was interesting as the Use and Free flaw has to do with access to 
  dead memory, and this commit had its hand in fixing just that. 
  Again 228 lines of testing was introduced, demonstrating further edge cases were discovered and taken care of.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I did not see any major events during this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
    This vulnerability was introduced via the includion of the IndexedDB API. The developers were unaware of specific
    edge cases that lead to the vulnerability. If they had built it from scratch, they would have known of the potential
    threat.

    note: |
    The whole premise of this bug is that a malicious user could try to access memory that had already been freed.
    By sanitizing and validating all user input, the developers were able to determine if that happening and prevent it.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
  As the bug report is not available, it is not clear whether this was a known issue
  with the library, or if it was specific to v8's implementation of it.
  If it were the latter, the mistake causing this vulnerability was improper implementation of 3rd
  party library, IndexedDB, as the developers failed to restrict certain key-path evaluations, 
  specically getter calls made to prototypes. 
  
  On the other hand, if the library unknowingly contained the bug, then IndexedDB would
  be at fault for testing all edge cases when it came to their systems security.
