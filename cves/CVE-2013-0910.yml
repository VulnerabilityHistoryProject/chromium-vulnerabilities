CVE: CVE-2013-0910
CWE: CWE-592
announced: 2013-03-05 16:55:23.690000000 -05:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Google Chrome previously did not properly manage browser interactions between browsers and
  renderers. The issue occurs when plug-ins are loaded or validated/authorized. 
  Attackers can use it to bypass access restrictions with blocked plug-ins due to 
  the exposed rendering process. The renderer is what loads the plug-ins in the browser, and is
  exposed enough to theoretically be compromised. If a renderer is compromised, there are no 
  longer any restricitions on the type of plug-ins that are loaded, and an attacker could use this
  to load in a nefarious plug-in.

  This vulnerability was not a found bug, but more of a security oversight. Someone discovered
  a potential vulnerability that could be corrected before it was ever an issue in practice.

  :note: 'This is just the previous commit, because there is not really a direct vulnerablity code introduction. When this vulnerability is introduced, it was the result of a thought experiment on how the code in general is unsafe. Plug-ins were handled this way in many locations, so there would not be one individual commit that caused this.'

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    Due to the nature of this vulnerability, it did not originally have unit tests, but it
    does have browser tests that were put in place to ensure it works properly. They did
    add one more test to ensure that certain plug-ins were unable to be loaded. Because this 
    vulnerability was not one specific issue but more of a previous oversight
    they added in regression tests and unit tests to ensure the new functionality was 
    working appropriately.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Some person with a gmail account, but not a google employee account, was experimenting
    with the idea of "breaking out of the Chrome sandbox." This goal of this sandbox, according 
    to the chromium website, is to prevent code from making persistent changes to the computer and 
    "to provide hard guarantees about what ultimately a piece of code can or cannot do no matter 
    what its inputs are." 
    There is no further information about the person that found this vulnerability other than their 
    gmail account without any personal information. They claim to have experience with Java and 
    the security(or lack thereof) involved with the language. They found a concern with the process 
    between renderers and authorized plug-ins. This vulnerability was merely
    reasoned out from curiosity and past experience.

  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    Between the code review and the bug reports, it appeared to all be located in the browser folder 
    with the code fixes in the plug-in folder.
  name: 'plug-ins'
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 6be31d20e5c3727f136b8dfe06cd7f27ebf898bb
    note: 'The author of the fix rewrote this code multiple times prior to submitting due to concerns about layering violations. It was interesting to see someone dedicate a large number of time to the first commit in the set of commits.'
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: 
  events:
  - name: Initial creation of the mentioned fix
    date: 2013-01-31
  - name: Fix needed to be reverted due to Windows issue
    date: 2013-02-01
  - name: After it was approved, a different developer mentioned issues with naming conventions
    date: 2013-02-04
  - name: Fix passed with renaming
    date: 2013-02-05
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: The vulnerability is concerned with the step after a renderer is theoretically compromised and preventing it from taking advantage of a user.
  least_privilege:
    applies: true
    note: Unless both a plug-in and Java have been approved, they will not allow a compromised renderer to load it in.
  frameworks_are_optional:
    applies: false
    note: 
  native_wrappers:
    applies: false
    note: 
  distrust_input:
    applies: false
    note: 
  security_by_obscurity:
    applies: false
    note: 
  serial_killer:
    applies: false
    note: 
  environment_variables:
    applies: false
    note: 
  secure_by_default:
    applies: true
    note: Originally, renderers were trusted by default and could load any plug-ins. After the fix, they were inherently untrusted and must have other checks involved.
  yagni:
    applies: false
    note: 
  complex_inputs:
    applies: false
    note: 
  sandbox:
    applies: true
    note: |
      This specific vulnerability affects the level of trust assosciated with the sandbox 
      because it allows a corrupted renderer to load any plug-ins that a nefarious user wants 
      it to load. This breaks out of the trust boundary set by the sandbox, and allows code to
      be executed with unpredictable consequences.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    All in all, I don't think that there were that many mistakes that were made that
    were avoidable. Someone with more experience with Java and plug-ins noticed a section
    of code that could be improved, and google responded accordingly. If any mistakes were
    made, it would be in the design phase. It also might be able to be considered a Maintainability
    issue, because as technologies evolved, they did not stay upgrade this feature accordingly.

    As far as the mitigations go, the only one mentioned on the cwe page is to use an authentication
    framework and library. However, this is not entirely relevant because we are not concerned with
    user authentication, but authentication of a renderer. This is a more unique problem than one that 
    can be solved with a default library. 

    The fix looks like a pretty good solution for a problem that is not very common.
