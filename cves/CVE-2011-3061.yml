CVE: CVE-2011-3061
CWE: 297

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The implementation of the code handling creating a socket connection to an
  intermediary, request-handling server recognizes that a certificate error
  exists but it appears to be ignored since it doesn't disconnect when the
  error is caught. This could have allowed for a man-in-the-middle attack
  where one could spoof a server and potentially get sensitive information
  with the created certificate.

fixes_vcc_instructions: |
  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- :commit: 2da73b6dae490567a781a9229bdd3c1b9a3f3769
  :note: The fix for this bug. The proxy is disconnected as soon as the
         certificate mismatch is realized.
vccs:
- commit: d9da5fe263e748c75d85816ee6bae46b2b9de9c9
  note: This is when the else block for catching the cert mismatch was added.
upvotes_instructions: |
  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There were unittests made for the module but the else block was never
    unit tested after it was added. When the fix was made, nothing was added
    to the corresponsing unit test to check that the fix worked.
  code: true
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Found by a Google employee pointing a proxy to an illegimate address and
    noticing the mismatch with the proxy still functioning as if there was no
    mismatch.
  date: 2012-03-01
  automated: false
  google: true

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer:
    This was found in the http subsystem. More particularly, it was in the
    http_proxy_client_socket_pool.cc.
  name: http
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 36478248362c460c5ce639ec84fb6568b71f18f0
    note: This commit was interesting because this was a couple hours before the
          fix was made. The person who made the fix made this commit for a
          semantic change not knowing that there would be a bug in the same code.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note:
      In this case, the mistake made here was just simply not acting when an
      erroneous state was noticed. Before the fix was made, it is evident that
      the else block was for if a certificate mismatch was found due to the
      given return statement. As soon as that was noticed, disconnecting would
      be the next obvious things to do but it wasn't at first.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer:
    The mistake could have came from a design mistake or an issue with
    requirements. The code was initially written to make sure to notice if a
    certificate mismatch is found. However, the proper next step of
    disconnecting was either not something explicitly stated in the
    requirements or it was supposed to be added initially, not something that
    was checked for in unit testing, or just got past code reviews and tests
    outright. The fix does look proper as it immediately does a disconnect.
