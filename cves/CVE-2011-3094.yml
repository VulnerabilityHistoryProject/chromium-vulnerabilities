description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The input validation vulnerability did not properly handle Tibetan text, and thus an
  out-of-bounds read could occur during Tibetan handling. If a Tibetan letter was followed
  by a Tibetan cantillation sign, a global buffer overflow would be reported.

  The vulnerability was located in the method called tibetan_form().

  This vulnerability could be exploited by remote attackers, who could execute arbitrary
  code on the system and cause a denial of service via the out-of-bounds read through
  the use of unspecified vectors. They can accomplish this by persuading a victim to
  visit a specially-crafted web site or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, where
  they could exploit the vulnerability to trigger the out-of-bounds read in order to
  execute the arbitrary code on the system.

  answer: |
    According to the information provided at https://www.securitytracker.com/id?1027067,
    a user by the name of "miaubiz" (also known as Brett Wilson) first reported this vulnerability.
    They explained that they made the initial discovery of this vulnerability when they noticed
    that a Tibetan letter was followed by a Tibetan cantillation sign, a global buffer overflow
    occurred.

  contest:
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    Based on the vulnerability details recorded in the following link -

    note: |
      Fixed two truncation bugs located in isMark and isLetter that led the
      'init' feature to be applied even when a word had no syllables at the
      beginning. It also removed two patches (Fix OOB access and Fix crash!)
      as well as added the upstream fix, Fix bug in contrib/harfbuzz-unicode.cc.

  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I saw two major events during this time.
  events:
  - name: The old Harbuzz was updated to Harfbuzz ToT

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    applies: true
    note: |
      The attacker would only need the same privilege as an average user, in order to
      deceive them in to visiting a specially-crafted site where they could exploit the
      vulnerability to trigger the out-of-bounds read and thus cause a denial of service.
      This could also show that the attacker has elevated their privilege beyond what an
      average user is capable of, to some degree, as an average user most likely would
      not be looking to execute a denial of service attack.

      An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system by luring the targeted user
      to a site that's specifically crafted to trigger the out-of-bounds read and thus
      cause a denial of service, and the fix for this vulnerability concerned preventing
      the input of Tibetan text that would be improperly handled and result in this error.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    A mistake that allowed for that out-of-bounds error was that some variable "c", which
    which represents the Tibetan unicode char hex value that can be used to find the index
    with the involvement of some math, was allowed to be either less than or equal to 0x0fc0,
    which in turn allowed that out-of-bounds error to occur. It appeared to have been an
    oversight in how the boundary cases were addressed and thus limited incorrectly.
