description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was located in the GenerateFunction 
  function in the path bindings/scripts/code_generator_v8.pm in Blink. It existed 
  because the aforementioned function didn't implement a specific cross-origin 
  restriction for the EventTarget::dispatchEvent function.

  The "events" processing component wasn't able to properly filter user input from 
  the HTML code before displaying the input.

  A way this vulnerability can be exploited is that a remote attacker can trigger
  Universal XSS (UXSS) attacks via vectors involving events, and can essentially 
  force the execution of arbitrary scripting code by the target user's browser within 
  the context of a different domain. Such as how it affected iframes, as it permitted 
  a page on an arbitrary site to retrieve the document element of any target page so 
  long as the following conditions concerning the target page were met - 
  (1) it may be imbedded in an iframe, (2) it has a handler for any window event,
  (3) it gets or sets any property of the event in any jQuery listener, and
  (4) it returns a dom node from the handler.

fixes_vcc_instructions: |
  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- :commit: 3c8dc8dac23722aa5b605b1f576d3948cf17af1e
  :note: |
    The fix was adding cross-origin BindingsSecurity checks to 
    'EventTarget: :dispatchEvent' on the Python side. For the IDL
    compiler, Python and r16999 were synced.
    I also noticed that this commit has a different bug, 239771, associated
    with it. This bug has to do primarily with poor maintainability of the IDL
    compiler.
    This commit, however, is necessary to find the vcc as it provides the 
    correct file path,third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/scripts/unstable/v8_methods.py,
    for doing so.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    The fix code clearly specifies that test cases should be added, and following
    the link, https://codereview.chromium.org/150203016, we can see that these
    tests were indeed successfully created and added.

  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    According to the information provided at https://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2883,
    a user by the name "aidanhs" had been the first one to discover a cross-site scripting
    issue in event handling. They presented the conditions in which a page on an arbitrary site 
    was permitted to retrieve the document element of any target page, and they included:
    (1) the target page may be embedded in an iframe; (2) the target page has a handler 
    for any window event; (3) the target page gets or sets any property of the event in 
    the handler (any jQuery listener); and (4) the target page returns a dom node from the handler.
    They explained that this vulnerability could be exploited by calling the event handler
    directly to obtain the dom node, and thus they were able to gain access to the targeted
    document. However, they were unable to execute an exploit without relying on the site returning
    a dom node in the event handler.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Based on the CVE description.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There were well over 20 commits recorded between the VCC and the fix, most of which
    are updates to the IDL compiler associated with the 239771 bug, which leads me
    to suspect that these implementations didn't have properly defined requirements
    upon beginning to make them, nor were they properly tested before committing. 
  commits:
  - commit: 3eb847af3710daeda0fa4453bd4662cd8fc1823a
    note: |
      This is the first commit I observed specifically mention that they'd included
      tests to ensure that 'implements' worked. It also adds new features to Python
      for the new test cases and removes the unused test cases for which Perl
      generated incorrect code. The EventHandler type method, methods with arguments
      in dependency, and [RaisesException] on interface methods were all added as
      new features.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I did not see any major events during this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      A remote attacker could be able to conduct cross-site scripting attacks by executing
      arbitrary scripting code in the targer user's browser in the context of a different
      domain, and the fix for this vulnerability was about preventing input that could
      lead to cross-site scripting attacks.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake seemed to stem from a lack of proper security checks in place. As stated
    previously in the description above, The "events" processing component wasn't able 
    to properly filter user input from the HTML code before displaying the input.
