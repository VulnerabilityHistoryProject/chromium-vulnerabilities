CVE: CVE-2015-1228
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 665
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true

  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There is an update counter method being called with a text updating 
  method. The bug-causing method updates the counter, but does not set the node
  for layout or reset. As a result, some stale text boxes may be left behind 
  after the program is complete. This causes variables to initialize incorrectly 
  (or fail to initialize at all) on following sessions, causing 
  the program to crash when it tries to use the variable (denial-of-serivce).
  Attackers aware of this vulnerability could work to trigger the crash
  intentionally. A different text updating method that marks the node
  for layout is used as a replacement, making sure all the right 
  validations are made and no stale/uninitialized text boxes are left behind.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    Was unable to locate unit tests for the vulnerability; issue was found
    with a Fuzzer and an employee did a manual re-run to ensure the
    vulnerability was no longer present.
  code: false
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: Discovered via Miaubiz Fuzzer
  date: 2014-12-22. 
  automated: true
  google: true
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There were no really interesting commits; this vulnerability was present in the code from
    the beginning, based on what was found. The fix was simply finding the cause of the problem
    about eight years from after the project's start.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      This vulnerability is caused by the existence of stale data through using C++.
      Such data issues do not exist in other languages like Java, Javascript, or Python.
      The vulnerabilities of the tools/languages used should be accounted for when building.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake was a simple design mistake at the start of the project.
    The team used a method that didn't clear the stale data of certain
    text boxes. The mistake was probably due to not testing that area and
    proper unit testing would have found likely found it early on.
    The mitigation, build and compilation, was used via a change of
    method once the vulnerability was found through fuzzer testing. 

    Note that this may also have been an implementation error, as the
    initial method they used is very similar to the fixing method
    except that the original method does not perform validation
    checking. It is possible that the initial method used simply did
    not do what was expected.
