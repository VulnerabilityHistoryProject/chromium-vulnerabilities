description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The vulnerability was in Blink, Google Chrome's browser engine, in a DOM 
  implementation of a tree data structure written in C. 

  A DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the 
  tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow 
  programmatic access to the tree. 

  The cause of this vulnerability was that it was possible for a variable called 
  TreeScope, which represents a DOM object root node, to be deleted while it was
  still in use in another context. 

  This created a use-after-free vulnerability. Use After Free refers to the 
  attempt to access memory after it has been freed, which can cause a program to crash
  in the best case, or can potentially result in the execution of 
  arbitrary code or even enable full remote code execution capabilities.

  Furthermore, crafted JavaScript code could trigger improper maintenance of TreeScope data through this vulnerability.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    The VCC does include fairly extensive unit-testing. 
    However, it is only testing performance as that was the bug being resolved in this commit.
    Both commits dedicated to fixing the Use After Free flaw did include the proper unit testing for this vulnerability.

    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    Found using ClusterFuzz then reproduced by hand.
    Below is the post made on https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=442806-
    "Confirmed. I could reproduce this.
    The root cause is that TreeScopeEventContext::m_treeScope is not a RefPtr.
    We should make TreeScope *RefCounted* somehow. I'm not sure this is a good idea.
    Maybe we can have another idea. " -hayato@chromium.org

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Based on the description in the CVE and blog post
  name: DOM
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
  - commit: 3a6fd28a6ce60c3ab3005e70ae5fb09eeb60a5fb
    note: |
      This was the first attempt to fix the bug. The developer added additional checks to ensure a null pointer 
      was not being acessed. This commit is interesting as it contains huge edits to test files,
      but only 5 additions and 1 deletion from the actual C file. This shows that the fix was not very complex,
      but did require extensive testing to ensure edge case coverage.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I did not see any major events during this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: This lesson is applicable as the system should run security checks at several levels, even redundantly, to ensure the system has not been exploited.   
  least_privilege:
    applies: false

      End Chrome users should not have access to the make calls to the freed memory addressed

  distrust_input:
    applies: true
    note: |
      The whole premise of this bug is that a malicious user could try to access memory that had already been freed.
      By sanitizing and validating all user input, the developers were able to determine if that happening and prevent it.
  security_by_obscurity:
    applies: true
    note: |
      As this vulnerability exploits system level DOM objects, the proper outer layers of security
      could, in theory, protect from this. For example, if you can prove that all system variables are fully encapsulated and
      therefore inaccessible to outside users, you could claim to be secure from exploitations of this vulnerability.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The user who committed the VCC introduced this vulnerability in his own code. 
    However, since the concern is that different event contexts require the TreeScope at 
    different times, it can be argued that this is a Design mistake first and foremost. 
    Pointers to the root node of a DOM object should be null after the root has been deleted.
    In this case the mitigation solution was to store a backup to the rootNode of
    the tree. Developers should have taken into account for the tight coupling between these
    two contexts, and the possiblity that actions in one scope would have catastrophic effects 
    on another. This is more of a band-aid fix that doesn't fully adress the fact that the 
    scope of these variable should not be so tightly coupled.
