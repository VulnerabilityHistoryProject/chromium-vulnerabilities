description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: "The WebGL implementation in Google Chrome allowed remote attackers to
  cause a \ndenial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.  This
  means that the\napplication was not verifying the inputs to the system properly
  and an attacker could\nhave utilized this vulnerability to crash the application,
  or perform more advanced exploits.\n\nThis vulnerability only presented itself when
  ran with a specific command line flag for\nhandling WebGL versions and the system
  had certain checks that were not performed\nWhen this flag was set.\n"

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There was a unit test for the initial code, but due to how the system was handling the inputs,
    there was a fix necessary in the way OpenGL handled this call as well. That being fixed separately,
    the fix included modified unit tests that included the flag test case and non-flag test case
    to show that the fix was valid.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered by someone who was not a Chromium project member. The user reported a
    computer crashing when Chromium segfaulted due to this vulnerability.
  date: 2011-02-02
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    The Chrome code that interfaces with WebGL and handles either client-side rendering or not
    based on the optional command line flag.
  name: WebGL
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 2fe6c79fdf2d51e309bfd4d6a3b21cdf5442dc69
    note: This commit was interesting as there was the causing bug in WebGL that was
      also fixed
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: true
  events:
  - name: The team is refactoring WebGL and PepperPlugin API code, this is a contributing
      factor to the vulnerability discovery

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    There were inconsistencies in the implementation of WebGL that led to the cause of the vulnerability
    and they were not discovered until edge cases were tested.  This vulnerability is essentially a
    buffer overflow allowed by lack of verification of inputs to the methods that utilize WebGL, so the fix
    was sufficient in dealing with the problem.
