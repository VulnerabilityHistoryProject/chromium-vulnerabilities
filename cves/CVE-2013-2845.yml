  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  A heap-use-after-free vulnerability in the Web Audio implementation of Google 
  Chrome, for playing audio through the Chrome web-browser, allows remote attackers 
  to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact. This kind of 
  denial of service is caused by memory corruption. 

  The fix for this vulnerability is to ensure that variables are not used once they
  are free-d or released. Also pointers should be passed by reference.

  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here
  was wrong. Otherwise, leave it blank.

  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    The fix did not mention the use of tests. All of the VCC commit 
    messages indicated that no new tests since audio API is not yet implemented.
  code: false
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Credit was rewarded to Atte Kettunen of OUSPG for finding this vulnerability. 
    It appears that Atte Kettunen reported this to the dev team, and they confirmed the issue
    on March 19, 2013 by running the automated fuzzer cluster-fuzz against the files.
  date: 2013-03-01
  automated: true

  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: all files are in the thirdparty/WebKit/Source directory
  name: thirdparty
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 4c0b4a4340796ec961b4dc335fa6f4890ccef2c3
    note: For AudioNodeOutput files, not much was changed, but also the bug was not discovered.
  - commit: eba7abc84aec970ce85a25cf7b655e424918a3e0
    note: |
      Also for AudioNodeOutput files, but the only lines modified were for paths to files.
      Interestingly, these were the only 2 commits that appeared in the logs between VCC & fix
      commits for the specific files.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I didn't observe any major events during this time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      The checking of buffer use after it was freed should occur, and not just assumed 
      that it is being safely used. There should be more checks at various levels.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The developers did not know that that the buffer was being used after it was freed. 
    I did not see any checks in place to ensure that the buffer was being cleared properly. 
    It looks like there was a design mistake with OwnPtr, and then a design decision to 
    change OwnPtr to RefPtr, and recreate the corresponding functions required. 

    Seems like the fix was not very simple. It took the creation of new RefPtr functions, 
    replacing many OwnPtr with RefPtr in many files, and realizing that some functions
    returned the AudioBus after it has been free-d.
