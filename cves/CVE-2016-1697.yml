description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  When loading a frame, the chromium rendering engine failed to disable frame
  navigations, allowing attackers create javascript code that would navigate
  to access a different page from an untrusted origin and perform cross site 
  scripting

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer:
  code: |
    The module contained browser tests in the form of html files that could 
    be loaded by the rendering engine in order to test the engine
  fix: |
    The fix added a new browser test file, start-load-during-provisional-loader-detach.html.
    This file was a direct test for the fix, in order to check that the fix was
    done correctly. Beyond this there were no additional tests added
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    This bug was discovered by an independent developer who was able to craft an
    exploit that would allow for cross site scripting in apple.com. The exploit
    was reproduced by Google employees after some effort, and a fix was implemented

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 73563fee12defb21a8f955993b68907169e1ea6d
    note: |
      This commit made changes to the way frame navigations could be enabled and
      disabled. Disabling frame navigations was an important part of the fix, so
      this commit may have affected the fix, and may have even contributed to 
      causing the exploit.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      The fix involved disabling a pages ability to navigate between frames
      during a certain point in the load process. It appears that taking
      away this priveledge didn't have any negative side effects, meaning
      it is a functionality that should have been disabled by default, even
      without the exploit.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was primarily the result of an oversight in the product
    design. Nobody considered how frame navigations could be used to exploit
    a weakess in this product. On top of this, since frame navigations were
    not a necessary function at this point of the execution, a good design
    choice would have been to have them disabled by default. The fix completely
    mitigates this exploit, since frame navigations cannot be exploited if they
    are entirely disabled. This change, however, was only applied to one part 
    of the code. Perhaps security by default can be applied to other areas of
    the code to prevent similar exploits from happening in the future.
