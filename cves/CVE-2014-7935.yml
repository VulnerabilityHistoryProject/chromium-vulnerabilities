CVE: CVE-2014-7935
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 416
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2015-01-21 15:11:00.000000000 -05:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The tts_message_filter.cc file in versions of google chrome before 40.0.2214.91 had a vulnerability that would
  try to use memory immediately after it had been freed. This would allow attackers to
  use the text to speech utterances to crash a user's current tab in google chrome and possibly
  execute other attacks such as executing remote code.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    While I did find a unit testing file, it doesn't seem that it was involved with
    testing for this vulnerability. I also found no automated tests within the file that had
    the vulnerability and the fix.

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    A user discovered this vulnerability by opening an incognito session
    of google chrome and went to a webpage that they created that allowed the
    user to click a button that would simulate a speech command. Once the user
    clicked that button, the webpage would use that vulnerability to crash chrome.

  automated: true
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    The subsystem that they were in was the speech subsystem.
  name: chrome/browser/speech/extension_api/
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    The only commit that I could find that happened
    in between the fix and the vcc were one commit that
    was an automatic patch where they updated and standardized the usage of virtual/override/final

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    I found a lot of just general updates to the chromium, but two major events I
    found were them removing an entire library from their codebase and adding unused code for a
    smart locking close proximity feature. The smart lock feature means that users can't unlock something
    unless they are in close proximity of the device that is logging in.
  events:
  - name: Removed HttpStreamBase from the codebase
    date: 2014-11-05
  - name: Added code for smart locking
    date: 2014-11-05
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

  complex_inputs:
    applies: true
    note: |
      the input was a very complex speech command, meaning that it would take
      up a lot of memory. Trying to fill memory that had just been freed with that
      complex input wrapped in the weak_ptr class this would really contribute to
      the use-after-free.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    After looking at the fix in the code, this is obviously a coding mistake, as they
    were using the weak_ptr class to prevent a UAF and the weak_ptr class was the part of the code
    that was allowing the use after free vulnerability to occur. If the team had done more through
    testing with their unit tests and their automation tests I believe that they would have found this
    vulnerability a lot sooner. Looking at the possible mitigations for the CWE and the fix for the code,
    they didn't change their code language or set their pointers to null after being freed. The second one
    can be excused though because it uses a complex data structure.
