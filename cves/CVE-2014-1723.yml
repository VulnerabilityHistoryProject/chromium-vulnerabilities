CVE: CVE-2014-1723
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: CWE-20
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability is actually a really cool one. Malicious actors could insert a right to left
  (RtL Character) into a url using their keyboard to create very misleading urls. The RtL reverses
  characters after it in a string in the GUI. This character is completely insivible to the users of chromium, 
  so it was almost impossible to detect. For example, a malicious user could use this character and create 
  a url like "coolcamsj.png". However, due to the RtL character in the url, the browser would actually read 
  the string as "coolcamgnp.js" and load that, which has the potential to be malicious javascript.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: true
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: This vulnerability was discovered by a good samaritan who found it
  date: 2014-01-24
  automated: no
  google: no
  contest: no
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: This bug was in the net/base code for chromium, based on the path of the file affected
  name: net
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits: 
  - commit: 8c0af3834e11d643562c13788c06c695f2666f51
    note: |
      It seems interesting to me that this bug was not found in the inital pass of the code.
      It seems like a big oversight on the developers part, which didn't see how this character could affect code.
      It also is worth noting that google handles bad characters with a blacklist instead of a whitelist. I feel 
      like the otherway around would be a better approach.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    It seems that nothing really was happening at the time of this vulnerabilty, as
    a non-google employee reported the bug. However, it is notable that the original 
    assignee to the bug was off of work for a couple of weeks when the bug was reported,
    so it is possible that this bug was left sitting for longer than possible. It looks
    someone picked it up soon there after though, since it was high severity.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      Since the vulnerability stems from a core trust of user input, this common lesson applies.
      It shows that we should NEVER trust user input, and instead should try to only allow things
      that we know will be safe for our application. For example, using a whitelist instead of a blacklist.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Personally, I think that requirement mistakes were made that led to this vulnerability. The original
    coders either didn't have knowledge of this character or how it could lead to problems in the future,
    but it eventually came up. Luckily, it was reported by a good samaritan, hopefully before any malicious
    users had the chance to use it against other users.
