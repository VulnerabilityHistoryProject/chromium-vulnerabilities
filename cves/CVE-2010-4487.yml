CVE: CVE-2010-4487
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 'CWE-184: Incomplete Blacklist'
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: "This CVE affects OSX and Linux.\nAn attacker could create a page that
  would serve a response with a \n'Content-Disposition: attachment' for a file with
  an HTML extension. The \n'Content-Disposition: attachment' forces the download dialog
  to appear, and it \nauto-selects the attacker's malicious HTML file. If the user
  clicks the file name \nin the download dialog, the malicious HTML file loads and
  downloads a SWF file to \nthe user's downloads directory. 'setTimeout()' can then
  be used to delay the \nloading of the SWF file until after it's finished downloading
  (~5 seconds). Once \nthe SWF file is downloaded, the attacker loads the SWF file
  which is written to \ngrab the contents of /etc/passwd and displays the contents
  of the file to the \nscreen. Now that your sensitive information is written to the
  browser, it can be \neasily transmitted back via JavaScript.\n"

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: As a result of this vulnerability being discovered, unit tests were put
    in place to ensure that similar vulnerabilities could be detected in the future.
  code: true
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: This vulnerability was discovered entirely via speculation by chromium contributors
    via the chromium forum.
  date: 2010-10-19
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: This mistake was in the download manager utilities, because it had an incomplete
    file extension blacklist.
  name: download_exe.cc
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: This was a very small event. The vulnerability was fixed with one small
    commit that extended the file extensions blacklist.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I believe this mistake happened because the developers finally finished the download_exe.cc file, and forgot to fill out a complete blacklist for non-Windows operating systems.

    There are two mitigations provided for this CWE.
    The first is to use both a blacklist and a whitelist, but that wouldn't be a good idea for this scenario because you can't predict exactly which file extensions people want to pass in a 'Content-Disposition: attachment'.
    The second is to not rely exclusively on blacklist validation. For this particular CVE, I believe a blacklist is just fine.

    They did not use either of these mitigations. They only had to add more extensions to the file extensions blacklist in order to fix the vulnerability.
