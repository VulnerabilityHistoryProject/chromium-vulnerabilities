description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There was a bug in Blink, the webkit used by Chromium that allowed an external
  resource to be loaded as CSS and interpreted with or without a correct MIME 
  (media) type. This bug made it possible for an attacker to leak data by using
  a CSS string injection. This bug was caused by the use of a method of interpreting
  CSS called "quirks-mode" which allowed for the parsing of non-standard CSS. 
  The bug had been encountered before in the past and an attempt was made to fix it
  by using a "strict-mode" to parse CSS with an incorrect MIME type. However, it was
  discovered that the attack was still possible if the attacker could change the
  charset to UTF-16. From my research it looks like quirks-mode had been removed before
  but it caused some issues with other tests and was added back in. Eventually it was 
  removed for good, the browser refuses to load cross-origin resources as CSS if the
  MIME type is incorrect.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: true
  code: true
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on directory. Webcore contains css parsing source and is part of WebKit
  name: WebCore
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: a646ba09b67d5510702761622b0239989cc9650d
    note: |
      This commit makes the CSS parser check for correct syntax of the CSS header. 
      This seems relevant because this vulnerability is due to whether non-standard
      CSS should be parsed or not.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: 
  events: 
  - name: 'Drop of quirks-mode was temporarily reverted because it seemed to be causing failures in PPAI input event tests which didnt send MIME types'
    date: '2015-02-06'
  - name: 'Fix seems simple yet took a year and a half to be done, finder allegedly found a real world example around the time bug exceeded deadline'
    date: '2014-12-13'
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    It seems that the original existence of quirks-mode in the first place is for the 
    purpose of parsing non-standard CSS. Non-standard CSS seems to be a sort of legacy
    support. 
    In the bug discussion one of the main arguments to drop quirks-mode was
    that Firefox had already done it. This vulnerability is a design mistake, quirks-mode
    was added in for compatibility purposes but it turned out that CSS with an incorrect
    MIME type could open up an opportunity for an attack.
    It is possible that quirks-mode could have been fixed to make it more secure.
    However removing the option entirely fixed the issue with only a minor 
    impact on compatibility
