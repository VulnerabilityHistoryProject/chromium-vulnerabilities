CVE: CVE-2016-5137
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 200
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2016-07-20
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  WebKit's schemeMatches function in the Content Security Policy does not apply
  http port 80 policies to https port 443 URLs and does not apply WebSocket (ws) 
  port 80 policies to WebSocketSecure (wss) port 443 URLs. 
  
  A Content Security Policy is a security measure that can be added to a site 
  to restrict what resources can be loaded in the browser. When the
  schemeMatches function does not treat image resources identically through 
  each protocol, an attacker can set a Content Security Policy that restricts
  images from http and ws protocols. When an attacker does this they can monitor
  the response time for the resources and determine if the user has visited 
  the image's domain previously (if the response time is quick, then the image
  is cached). This is sniffing browser history.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There is a series of tests for the CSPSource file and additional tests were
    added to check for equalizing :80 and :443 ports and negating other ports

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    This bug report was completed by Xiaoyin Liu, who has an @outlook.com email
    address, suggesting that they are not a Google employee. The vulnerability 
    was found by Xiaoyin after manually recreating the Sniffly vulnerability, 
    which required bypassing code that was implemented specifically to fix the
    original Sniffly vulnerability. The explanation can be found at the mozilla
    bug reports page https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1285003 where
    Xiaoyin reported the vulnerability to mozilla (the vulnerability was present
    in both Firefox and Chrome).

  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    The vulnerability was in the third_party subsystem of Chromium, specifically
    in the WebKit library. The mistake was in the Content Security Policy file
    in Webkit.
  name: third_party/WebKit
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The reporter also found that the same vulnerability is present in the
    Mozilla Firefox browser.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      A Content Security Policy is an input for a web browser and this 
      vulnerability is an example of how it can be used to hurt a user
      instead of protecting them, thus it should be distrusted.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer:  |
    This is a coding mistake.
    
    The Chromium developers defined the proper requirements and design, 
    which is apparent through their mitigation efforts, but they missed the 
    specific cases when dealing with explicitly defined port numbers.
