announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2011-10-25 15:55:00.963000-04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: An attacker can use this vulnerability to spoof the value in the URL
  bar. This means the victim could be rerouted to a different website, but still see
  their intended address in their URL bar.  This only occurred when navigating to
  a different area of the same page, known as a page fragment.
bounty_instructions: |
  If you came across any indications that a bounty was paid out for this
  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here
  was wrong. Otherwise, leave it blank.

fixes:
- :commit: d466b8a0b44ef89c81fa4ede86de1b488b8ec07d
  :note: 'This was the first commit to fix the vulnerability in both the RenderView
    and the NavigationController.  It did so by dropping stale navigations'
- :commit: 5cad491f0f70c951e42823affb83140d05709adf
  :note: 'This commit reverted the changes made in the last commit and solves the
    problem a different way. Instead of dropping stale navigations, it resurrects
    the navigation entry it was going to.'
- :commit: 485e82382158c51e905df6d444fb536e6152e936
  :note: 'This commit added a second line of defense against spoofing.  If an unknown
    entry is committed, the renderer process will be killed.'

  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.
upvotes: 5
unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: Yes, there were unit tests both before and after the fix.  They were updated
    when the fix was introduced.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: This vulnerability was discovered by user jconsult...@gmail.com.  At first,
    his steps to reproduce the vulnerability did not work for the other developers,
    so they marked it as low severity.  A few days later, another developer found
    an easier way to reproduce the vulnerability and also found the root cause.  It
    was then changed to high severity.

  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: As it turned out, there were a few subsystems that allowed the vulnerability.  One
    was in the NavigationController, and the other was in the RenderView.
  name: NavigationController, RenderView
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: I was able to look at about 40 commits prior to the fix before running into
    a commit that moved the entire NavigationController from one directory to another.  Unfortunately
    I couldn't find where the previous directory was, so I couldn't specify the file
    in the git log. This meant I was unable to see the other commits, of which I'm
    sure there were hundreds.  Of those 40 commits, none seemed to relate to the spoofing
    vulnerability.  A couple dealt with history items and navigation, but not in a
    way that would trigger the vulnerability.
  commits:
  - commit: 49bd30e63977b446bbd74f0056b717ca7505208b
    note: This commit dealt with a different bug, but it modified the behavior of
      how pending entries were handled during navigation.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: The code was refactored by moving core pieces of Chrome multi-process code
    into the src/content directory.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: The mistake here was that there wasn't proper communication between the
    NavigationController and the Renderer.  Since the NavigationController needs to
    communicate with the HistoryController to figure out where to go when the user
    presses the back button, this allowed time for a race condition to form that confused
    the NavigationController into allowing stale entries.
