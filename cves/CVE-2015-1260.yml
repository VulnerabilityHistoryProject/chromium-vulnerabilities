CVE: CVE-2015-1260
announced: 2015-05-20 06:59:12.540000000 -04:00
description: Attackers can execute arbitrary Java Script code upon completion of a
  getUserMedia request. The fix prevented the RenderFrame object from being destroyed
  within the getusermedia subroutine, thus eliminating the "free" in the "user-after-free"
  vulnerability. During testing and fixing, this was deemed medium severity.
