CVE: CVE-2013-2914
CWE: 825
announced: 2013-10-02 06:35:35.167000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  In the color chooser dialog on Chrome before 30.0.1599.66, 
  ColorChooserDialog::listener_ did not properly dereference when the color
  chooser dialog was destroyed because of a page destruction (page close).
  This led to a stale reference that attackers could use to cause
  denial-of-service or attack using vectors.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    From looking at the comments and the fix code, I cannot say whether or not
    this code was unit tested. There is no mention of unit testing the patch
    anywhere, but that does not mean that unit testing was not involved. The
    commit itself could not be googled to confirm this.
  code:
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    This bug was found randomly by Khalil Zhani. He then traced his steps and 
    reported his findings. This bug could cause denial-of-service or be hit by a 
    compromised renderer, so this was marked as high severity

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: Based on the description in the CVE

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: c41ee9795537f0fc6a1f2a07e90e0edefc21c99c
    note: |
      This commit was for an initial implementation designed for Aura. This
      commit seems to have exposed the vulnerability by changing how the listener
      gets its flags to close the Color Chooser.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The only major event I found was the development of Aura, a rich notification
    client that got the notifications from chromium and put them in a different
    window. The vulnerability got exposed because of changes related to Aura.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      Part of the problem was that the input from this reference was never
      policed. This led to the problem that if this reference was never deactivated,
      an attacker could use it to cause denial-of-service or attack through the 
      reference.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The coding mistake was a pretty simple one. The original author simply did
    not kill the reference when the page was closed (destroyed). This is essentially
    a XSS vulnerability; through this stale reference, attackers can cause 
    denial-of-service or attack using vectors through this reference.
    
    The vulnerability was introduced in the initial commit, and was only exposed
    after Chrome tried to initially make Aura, an obsolete client meant to provide
    notifications and notification details in a client outside of Chrome. The 
    original author must have forgotten he needed to destroy the reference so it
    couldn't be used, or he didn't notice that he was leaving a stale reference.
    
    For this color chooser dialog, this vulnerability could have been prevented,
    but it's an easy thing to overlook. Next time, I'm sure the author will make
    sure something like this won't happen again.
