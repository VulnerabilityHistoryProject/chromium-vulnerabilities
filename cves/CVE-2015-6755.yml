announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: '2015-10-15 06:59:00.120000000 -04:00'
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description:  |
  This issue is found in chromium reported on august 11 2015 found by Mariusz
  Mlynski.

  From /WebKit/Source/core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp:

  parserRemoveChild| can run script, and it can remove |nextChild| from DOM or
  move the node around. When this happens, the tree will be in an inconsistent
  state after the |insertBeforeCommon| call, allowing an attacker to bypass the
  frame restrictions.

  Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code, bypass certain
  security restrictions and perform unauthorized actions and to gain access to
  sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

    Commit was an addition to the 'parserInsertBefore' function, that
    made a simple check if a referenced 'nextChild.parentNode()' was not
    equal to 'this', return out of the function.

  :note: |
    While many people contributed to this file, user 'Esprehn' was
    ultimately responsible for not adding the check for a child's parent node.
    In his commit, he is running a script to obscure cases involving the
    changing of children of a script element. This script can move the element
    the parser is trying to insert back into the page so that parserInsertBefore
    would insert the newChild into the tree again.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There were unit tests performed to ensure the bug fix. In 
    scriptexec-during-ParserInsertBefore.html, Mlynski added a new function
    that removed a trial node, and added HTML 'shouldBe' checks.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    Mariusz Mlynski first brought attention to the file and opened up an issue. This
    issue was later confirmed by user 'Esprehn', as he states that an alert dialogue displays
    the wrong origin.
  date: 2015-08-15
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: this bug occurred in the DOM of the chromium Webkit.
  name: DOM
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There weren't any particularly interesting commits here besides the fix. All that happened
    was the commit was discovered by Mlynski, then it was confirmed by Esprehn. Mlynski then points
    out to Esprehn where potential XSS could occur because of this mistake. Finally Mlynski fixes
    the bug.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The code was originally written but not checked thorougly enough by
    user 'Esprehn'. The bug was noticed by Mariusz Mlynski who opened an issue on
    the project. That issue was then verified by user 'Esprehn' by using alert dialogues
    to check the current node head. Mlynski then wrote a fix to the file. There is no 
    evidence of a team change or re-written systems that affected this system.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      This principle is a good example of what happened here. There only needed
      to be a simple check on the node inputs in order to fix this issue, and it was
      caused by an edge case. That edge case was left unchecked because the program
      worked without it, so it was deemed unneeded until a security issue was raised
      in light of it.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    It really just boils down to improper testing on this one. This was an edge
    case that the original author did not check for. The original user
    who wrote the code didn't check the parent of the nextChildNode, and simply
    didn't see the potential vulnerability there. All that took to fix it was a
    simple check, and if failed, a return statement.
    The issue was a really severe security risk, and could have been used to
    perform attacks on users by executing arbitrary code and gain access to private
    information. These seem like dire consequences for a missed check, but it doesn't
    take much for an attacker to gain access to a system.
    After making the fix, it maintains the integrity of the DOM tree, as the insertion
    of the newChild node is aborded, and the addition of the return statement rectifies
    the ability for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability in this edge case.
