announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2015-07-22
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Crafted javascript in a PDF file could be used to crash chrome or potentially
  lead to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is caused by javascript causing
  the PDFium (PDF) engine to enter a method, multiple times by causing document level and
  field level java script to interact using the field.delay property. This would free
  a freed pointer. This vulnerability would trigger Chromium's AddressSanitizer, a
  memory checking library, which would crash Chromium so further damage could be prevented.

  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    New vulnerability specific unit tests were added to test the vulnerability
    after it had been discovered. The code in question had been a part of a unit
    test, but the unit tests did not catch the vulnerability. The improvements included
    two new test pdf files that targeted this vulnerability specifically.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    It appears that this vulnrability had existed in PDFium within Chromium for a significant period of
    time. PDFium started off as a closed source project before being open-sourced in June 2014. This vulnerability
    was discovered approximately 13 months later in July 2015. According to git blame, the code in question was written
    before PDFium was open-sourced, making it impossible to trace the origins of the vulnerability. There were no changes
    to the lines of code in question during the 13 months between open source and discovery. Therefore, there are no remarkable
    commits to note.

  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      Reducing the capabilites of the JavaScript API in PDF's as much as possible is a 
      mitigation that should be considered. This could fall in line with YAGNI - 
      Adobe (the makers of the PDF standard) should look at how much of the JS API is 
      actually needed for a good average user experience.

      Crash could be caused in JavaScript by exploiting Chrome's PDF engine
      by causing a memory problem only present in unmanaged languages.
  distrust_input:
    applies: true
    note: |
      Vulnerability is only exploitable by PDF files. PDFs should be considered
      untrusted input, since their contents are unverified until they are opened.

      Allowing Javascript in PDF's is an inherent vulnerability in and of itself. 
      One good coding principal is to sandbox any executing Javascript as much as possible, 
      due to the high probability that a userwill open a malicious PDF.

    note: |
      The interesting tidbit is that this vulnerability was actually exploiting code designed to
      fail securely. When free() was called twice in Chromium, the application would automatically
      terminate to prevent memory errors (ie. failing securely). However, what the developers
      did not consider was that purposely invoking free() consecutively would allow arbitrary code
      to crash the browser. 
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake was a design mistake and a coding mistake. One thing the developers did well was
    that they followed the fail securely principal. Freeing a pointer twice could cause undeterministic
    outcomes - as a result it is best to terminate when such an error occurs. However, most people
    do not consider a vulnerability fix or good coding practice to also something that can be exploited
    for malicious purposes. That was the case in this scenario. Knowing a foolproof mechanism to
    crash the browser lead to malicious PDF's that could simply invoke that failsafe over and over - 
    writing a PDF that forced the browser to free a pointer twice, intentionally crashing it.

    One potential solution that could be considered is to forbid Javascript in PDF's entirely - JS
    in PDF's is an enormous security risk by itself that there should be debate whether or not the benefit
    of having a Javascript API is worth the security headaches.
