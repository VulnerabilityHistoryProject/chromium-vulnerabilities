  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  In Blink, a web browser engine, trying to use a an HTML page builder,
  a Document object, that was dereferenced already. Meaning that it can no
  longer be accessed, could result in attackers potentially causing a crash to
  the system or result in unexpected code being inserted and executed into
  the application to result in unexpected effects.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    Due to the vulnerability being found in unit testing, and mentions in the 
    bug report of the test case that caused the crash, there were unit tests 
    involved in this vulnerability. The bug was reproduced by hand to be tested
    after the fix.     
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    A crash report was generated after a test case ran crashed the ASAN build.
    This led to a trace through several files to find that a Document was 
    unprotected, causing it to be lost in the process, and then trying to be 
    used at the same time for also known as a use-after-free implication. 
    The vulnerability was found by CloudFuzzer.

  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    Looking at the root directories, this vulnerability was involved with
    Blink under their core files for the DOM.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    commit: 
    note: |
      There was only a single commit that added the one line that protected the
      Document from being lost. As such there were no interesting commits. 
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was thought to be similar to other cases where the 
    heap was used after freeing from it. Therefore the problem was passed to another
    team that had more experience to fix the bug. This bug went untouched for a few 
    weeks after, until it was considered an old bug and then already fixed,
    but reported late.    
  events:
  - name: Bug passed off to another team to fix
    date: 2014-08-14
  - name: Bug goes unsolved/unmentioned for 2 weeks from this point.  
    date: 2014-08-27
  - name: Bug gets fixed upon review and posted.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    applies: true
    note: |
      The fix for this vulnerability was to protect the Document to make sure
      that if it were to be called again it would not crash the system, even 
      after its has been done with.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was difficult to track to find the root cause, and then
    figuring out how to fix it. The Document pointer was never set to null like
    the mitigations recommend from the CWE, but there were cases where the 
    Document needed to continue to run. Miscommunication was an issue in fixing
    this bug since no group found the answer quickly, even under its high 
    severity security warning. This bug was left open for a month from the start, 
    which may cause maintenance issues in the future if this were to reoccur. 
    Additionally, testing was difficult to create for the fix since certain
    scripts were not compatible for what needed to be run for this particular bug.
