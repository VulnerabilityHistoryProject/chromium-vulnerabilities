announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2010-01-25
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Chromium sends an HTTPS URL in the Referer header to an HTTP site when redirecting
  from a secure HTTPS site to an unsecure HTTP site. 
  
  The 'Referer' header is the address of the previous web page from which a link 
  to the currently requested page was followed. An unsecure HTTP site may obtain 
  sensitive information embedded in the HTTPS URL such as password reset links.

  Even if the security of the site is not compromised, the user of the site may 
  not want the information shared.

  answer: |
    Found by manually examining the referrer header after first visiting a URL 
    secured by HTTPS and then clicking a secure HTTPS link that triggers a redirect 
    to an unsecure HTTP URL.

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.

  commits:
  - commit: e600c8212f8922d77815316ff41fd8ce9d95bca7
    note: |
      They added a method to sanitize the referrer header to remove potential usernames 
      and passwords. It is not clear from the issue referenced if this change was for 
      automated testing purposes only or if this was an attempt to mitigate leaking sensitive data
      in the wild.
  - commit: 6568a9e384e0f92422c68d4f31fb401df4acbaed
    note: |
      They worked on some CSRF issues with following a temporary redirect (307 error) for a moved URL.
      It appears that the redirect allowed for custom headers and body of the original request
      to be re-transmitted to the victim site which could result in session hijacking and
      loss of sensitive information.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    applies: true
    note: |
      The vulnerability involves dependencies on server implementations 
      outside the control of the browser's developers. The developers have to 
      brainstorm the possible usages of the referrer header as well as in what 
      cases it should and should not be sent with a request. This is further 
      complicated by the number of methods a request can use and by the number
      of protocols handled by the browser. 
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake was essentially not handling an edge case where a request
    was made from a secure site to an unsecure site using a redirect. The fix
    itself was only 2 lines of code to check to see if the referrer header should 
    be cleared before redirecting. It was clear that the developer's knew from the
    beginning of the repository that the referrer should not be sent from an HTTPS 
    site to an HTTP, and did not in other cases, but this was not implemented in 
    redirecting.

    The CWE vulnerability mitigations suggest that this could have been avoided
    in the Architecture and Design phase by drawing unambiguous trust boundaries.
    It would be interesting to see if there were updates to security related
    design documentation to show how a redirect can be used to leave a site
    secured by HTTPS. 
    
    The fix itself appears well enough, but it is hard to tell if there was a lesson 
    learned by the developers from this mistake since it is unclear why this case
    was missed (other than just complexity). It is not even safe to say that all
    instances of the referrer crossing trust boundaries are handeled or that future
    functionality will not repeat the same mistakes.
