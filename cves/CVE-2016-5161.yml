CVE: CVE-2016-5161
CWE: 229
announced: 2016-09-11 06:59:17.817000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There was an issue in with custom CSS properties in Google chrome
  when merging styles together. Their old implementation serialized the CSS
  property value and then reparsed it which didn't preserve the name of the
  custom property. Someone could construct a custom property that would cause a
  denial of service for Chrome. In their test example the CSS that was causing
  the issue was '--A:var(---B)' and 'float:var(--C)' applied to two spans. When
  these styles were merged it would create a case where the system could end up
  reading memory that wasn't allocated which could result in a segmentation
  fault.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: true
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
      It was discovered by 62600BCA031B9EB5CB4A74ADDDD6771E at Trend Micro's
      Zero Day Initiative. It was reported on the bug site by zdi-disc...@hp.com
      and it looks like either the ... is part of the email or there's an issue
      with the site.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
      It was in the third party library WebKit.

      WebKit
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: d8055bceb97d14e28bdbce373062705ce080f014
    note: |
        Here they changed from using an iterator to using a for loop with an
        index.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    I saw in one of the commits that in WebCore they were trying to only
    expose the CSSOM API in CSSStyleDeclaration, they said they want "to split
    the CSSOM API from the internal implementation."

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
        They're issue wasn't completely related to this because it should
        have been able to understand the CSS, but they had failed to consider
        a speicific type of input.

        There was some CSS that they hadn't considered with custom properties,
        and that broke their code.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
      It was a design mistake. They failed to consider a certain type of input,
      which when entered had the potential to break their system. They should
      have considered CSS properties with custom values when desiging the
      merging functionality.
