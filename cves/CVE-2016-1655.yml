CVE: CVE-2016-1655
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: CWE-416
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curation_level: 1
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2016-01-28 
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Before 50.0.2661.75, a denial of service / use-after-free vulnerability exists 
  in Google Chrome where a crafted extension can be used to create an infinite 
  amount of new hidden windows that each have an observer tied to it that is
  not deleted on frame removal

  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:

  :note: |
    This fix allows the developers to cancel un-trusted code execution after a 
    frame has been removed. This was done by moving code execution from an 
    observer to a callback.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    This code was unit tested before and after the patch. Before, there were 
    unit tests that did not test for this vulnerability, but similar ones, and 
    after there were unit tests that specifically tested for this
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was found manually by someone bug hunting most likely 
    for the reward money. It required setting up a local server that 
    specifically targeted this vulnerability, and then executing things at a 
    certain time. Although not specifically stated, the likelihood this was found
    on accident is slim.
  date: 2016-01-28
  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    Extensions & Renderer
    The vulnerability is in extentions because of the way it handles observables
    and it is in renderer because of the way it executes the observables in the
    renderer.
  name: extensions - renderer
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.

  commits:
  - commit: 43ea0649d4b70fdcf3e9fa5c03aee1bbba0b04bb
    note: |
      This entire commit is one giant patch, and within this patch there is code
      duplication. I'm surprised it was not abstracted out in any way.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    This bug as described before is a design flaw that has been apparent from 
    the beginning. The only noteworthy event was the choice to use observables 
    from the start without the thought to need to ever cancel them. Because of 
    this, I'm sure people did not want to change over to callbacks to allow for 
    them to be queued up and cancelled if neccessary.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      Because of the use of observables rather than callbacks, people never 
      thought of the need to cancel them. Due to their implementation, the 
      observables were not able to be cancelled, and so the switch to callbacks 
      was necessary.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This was mainly a design mistake with a slight requirements mistake.
    The design mistake was using observables that were not able to be cancelled.
    It was never explicitlly stated, however I believe if the ability to easily
    cancel them was available, a developer would have had the thought to protect
    against this vulnerability. This is a requirements mistake because it was 
    not specifically stated to test against this. However, this requirements 
    mistake is within reason, beacuse this exploit was extremely well crafted 
    and required many layers of exploitation. It is not reasonable to plan for 
    this exact vulnerability beforehand. I believe this fix is a correct balance
    between how invasive it is, and how well thought designed it is.
