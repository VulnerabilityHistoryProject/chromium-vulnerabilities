  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2016-06-01
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The function that allows an extention to create a custom type,
  createCustomType, doesn't actually validate the module type. 
  Since the type isn't ever validated, there's the risk of 
  loading in arbitrary modules and disclosing sensitive 
  information to the attacker because the definition of the module
  was not handled properly.
bounty_instructions: |
  If you came across any indications that a bounty was paid out for this
  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here
  was wrong. Otherwise, leave it blank.

vccs:
- :commit: 7c04d6b9c93908426b98dcb2d5fe4a90eebf9251
  :note: |
  In this commit, the createCustomType() method never does any validation
  on the type corrected. This led to creating data types that could load
  arbitrary modules, something that the second fix directly countered by
  adding a whitelist for module types (hard coded fix, but the number of
  APIs used has stayed the same ever since the introduction of the js_modules
  in the code - crbug.com/222156 to be specific) and then compared the 
  created type to a type within the whitelist.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There is unit testing used as described in reviews and the bug report
  code: |
    A small amount of unit testing was added and is listed in code review
    1899973002, but there was a lot of work done by rob@robwu.nl whenever
    actually reporting the bug, even an entire proof of concept explained
    for testing!
  fix: | 
    More tests were added for initializing variables to make sure that there
    aren't issues with that anymore.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered by rob@robwu.nl when working on unit tests.
    Most interestingly enough, Rob had come up with a large proof of concept that
    demonstrated exactly how detrimental this vulrenability could be. During testing,
    he noticed that the schema objects persisted across page loads, allowing it to 
    be modified when the page is reloaded, thus accessing arbitrary bindings and
    disclosing information. The bugs page contains a lot of in-depth information
    about this issue and is quite impressive as it has a high level of polish
    and testing done, especially for a non-Chrome employee.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: renderer
  name: extensions/renderer/resources/binding.js
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    It took a very long time to actually notice this bug - the part of the
    code that didn't validate variable types was created in 2013 but not
    noticed until 2016. The commit history is very interesting to read as
    you notice how it wasn't questioned for years.
  commits:
  - commit: b155037ce9ddda46e7260c94bd8cfccdc9fc6404
    note: | 
      There was another bug being fixed where one commit within the binding.js file
      broke various builds of Chromium due to not correcting old resource references. 
      I find it interesting that it took awhile to fix that issue when it has a 
      higher impact on the system overall - maybe the cases where it broke weren't
      being tested as much?
  - commit: 33076cbe96e8eb8c50541e40f5266955c3db667f
    note: |
      This commit reverted a commit (68c06a78f74212907faafd985b0bdee67a6d4120
      to be exact) that was made 8 days prior. It caused a performance regression
      and was noted that "it should be revisited later". The commit prior resolved
      a dependency issue, but this specific commit removed that code entirely and
      wasn't reworked until a later commit. It's interesting to note how much code
      can change in a small amount of time and that the same person was able to
      realize this issue by himself.
  - commit: d0ea23a1ad1e50dc083b68984035fea153b30eb2
    note: |
      This commit was just a style fix, but it's interesting to see how this 
      was only considered in 2015, 2 years after the file's creation. Coding
      standards are different from person to person, and this person who 
      made the commit (rdevlin.cronin@chromium.org) felt that a different
      style was necessary. Considering it was changing enums to be in all
      caps, a now commonly recognized and used styling for enums, this was
      an important fix that can help reduce confusion when other employees
      review it or try to refactor code.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    The style for everying in the system was changed between the VCC and the 
    fix for the VCC as well as a new API was added (mimeHandler) to handle
    access of streams from RenderFrames to ensure that no outside streams
    can access data. It handles the one specific instance at a time, creating
    a major change in handing streams, removing the need for a user-exposed
    view ID and an event running in the background to handle it.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

  distrust_input:

    note: |
      The whitelist is a prime example of distrusting input as it ensures that the
      input is of a certain type; without the whitelist, these unhandled types can 
      be exploited to reload the page and access arbitrary data. Whitelists and 
      blacklists are huge tools to help ensure that input is exactly how you want
      it to be.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    There was a big design mistake in allowing the use of multiple types 
    without validating what types are actually safe when initializing. 
    Other parts of the code depend on the setup to work exactly as intended,
    and, without this validation, other parts of the code won't work in
    the way that they should. While this fix is hard-coded, the addition
    of a whitelist is a huge step in the right direction. There could be
    a better way to implement this whitelist rather than a hard-code 
    within the type creation, however, although keeping that data
    secure is very important.
