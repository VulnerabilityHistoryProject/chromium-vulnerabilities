CVE: CVE-2011-2358
CWE: CWE-20
announced: 2011-08-02 20:55:01.190000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Extension completed installation without first prompting the user with a ui to confirm 
  installation completion. This could lead to the user downloading malicious extensions without 
  realizing it if they clicked on a fake download link or something similar. Malicous 
  changes to a user's system could occur because of this without the user's knowledge.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    Android had an xss notorious security bug that occured in a similar way where xss within the 
    gallery led to installs on the machine. An employee realized chrome extensions had the same 
    vulnerability as there was no required prompt to begin a download.

subsystem: 
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    The issue was found within the extensions module
  name: |
    extension_webstore_private_api.h
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits: |
    Maybe not a specific commit but the commits before the fix are all creating the extension 
    store for chrome which is interesting since it never existed previously and is a big part
    of the browser now.
  - commit: b1f04cca79abf
    note: |
      "This function must be called during a user gesture" seems like they were thinking about 
      requiring user confirmation but didn't test correctly or think about all circumstances.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: This bug occured right after the creation of the extension store. It began with them creating sign in and profile functionality which is very widely used now in chrome and they added the extension store on top of that. This bug occurred durring the original creation of the subsystem.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I think this problem was brought about by a requirements issue. 
    It seems no one thought of the impact of downloading extensions without prompt until a similar 
    ssue happened  on Android that was very damaging. The fix was very straight forward and makes 
    sense. Adding a prompt for free extensions ensures that the user at least understands that 
    they are downloading something. Not showing the confirmation for paid extensions also makes 
    sense as the user will have to put in their payment info, ensuring that they understand 
    that they are buying and downloading something.
