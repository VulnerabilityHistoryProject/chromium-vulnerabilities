CVE: CVE-2014-3172
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 264
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2014-08-26
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The Debugger Extension API, as part of Chromium's developer toolkit, 
  does not validate the tab's URL before attaching itself to the url. 
  This allows an attacker to get root access and bypass password restrictions that might
  be on the URL.
  This access includes access to files located on the domain being hosted by the site,
  like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files, as well as any static files that may exist.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    They added unit tests to the fix code to ensure that the code was tested and prevent from the vulnerability from occuring again.
    New functions were added that check if the chrome tab has permission to attach to extension background pages and other targets.
    The new unit tests added work check the targets that the chrome tab can attach to and check functions such as 'CanAccessTab();'
    prior to attatching the debugger.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    A contributor came accross the vulnerabilty looking through the code, and reproduced it by hand. They realized that access to a
    victim's keys and hardware through the tab debugger tab. The attacker can wiretap the victim's microphone, disable their touchpad,
    mess with wifi and cellular hardware, factory reset the user's device, and more.

  automated: false
  google: false
  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: | 
    The mistake took place in the Chrome Debugger that exists within Chromium. 
    The subsystem name is based on the files they take place in.
  name: Debugger, PermissionsData
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    None. The VCC and the fix are the only two commits that happened in both subsystems. 
    These took place over the course of around 20 days.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
        The defenses added were deeper, as more checks of permissions were added to make sure that
        the url being accessed is not restricted in any way.
  least_privilege:
    applies: true
    note: |
        The API assumes it has minimal privileges and when mounting a URL that may be
        restricted. Then it checks to see if it has access.
        If not, it will report an error and fail.

  distrust_input:
    applies: true
    note: |
        The Debugger now distrusts the URL to mount, checking to make sure it is not
        restricted in any way.

  secure_by_default:
    applies: true
    note: |
        The system now assumes it does not have immediate access, and thus checks for permissions before mounting.
        This makes sure it does access any data located on a restricted network/path.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake here was an oversight on the development team's part. It seems they
    did not account for situations where the url in question would be restricted or
    limited access. Without that assumption, access to files and information could
    lead to a malicious user stealing code or data.
