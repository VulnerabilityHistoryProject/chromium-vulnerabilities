CVE: CVE-2014-9689
CWE: 
announced: 2015-03-08 20:59:02.450000000 -04:00
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
    A sensor in Chrome would not properly restrict access to high-rate gyroscope and accelerometer data on mobile devices, 
    providing data to websites without any permission prompts. Since these senors monitored keystrokes (and speech to an extent), 
    a user would be able to listen in to the events caused by keystrokes and obtain information from a device's physical location. 
    This would mean that a user could unknowingly compromise sensitive data (passwords, etc) to certain sites

fixes_vcc_instructions: |
  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- :commit: [d771a782774564197c9c4d3ddd07605e53397a12]
  :note: | 
    The fix implemented a checking method that would make sure that events weren't delivered to Blink at a rate faster than 60 Hz

  :note: |
    The vulnerability's starting point was difficult to pinpoint, so the commit that started the function that would check the data was
    noted.
upvotes_instructions: |
  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:true
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: | 
    The entire fix was essentially making sure there was a test to check against the events being handled.
  code: true
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    There isn't a clear answer as to how it was founded, but it was noted that the bug was known about for quite some time, with no
    one bothering to fix it.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: |
    It seems that the big impacted any device with an accelerometer or gyroscope,so mostl likely device sensors. Also take note that the bug was
    tagged under Android and iOS.
  name: device_sensors
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits: |
    I did not seem to find any of the commits to be worth noting. The vulnerability's fix was just an addition of tests to make sure
    that malicious users could not take advantage of the event data. The code between the VCC and the fix, all did what they were meant to
    do and it didn't seem as if there were any point where a developer may have overlooked the events being handled.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    In the code review, this vulnerability was noted to be somewhere between a vulenrability and  feature request. Also, developers were debatting on whether a user
    could/would make a privacy-conscious decision when it came to their geolocation and accelerometer use. There was a lot of back and forth 
    on how to properly go about solving the issue that was created by this bug

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
        Users weren't being prompted nor notified whenever they might have been using a device sensor, so this made it a lot easier
        for attackers to come in and access information on a user's device.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I feel as this was definitely a design issue, being as the mistake was a lack of deep testing. The code that was changed was already a unittest, 
    so for most it would seem as that would have been enough in regards to testing the issue. What the original code didn't do was to check to perform any
    additional tests.
