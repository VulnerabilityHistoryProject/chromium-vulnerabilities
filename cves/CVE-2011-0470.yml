description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  This issue was reported on Oct. 5 2010 by chromium user 'Eroman', and fixed by
  user 'johnnyg' on Dec. 1 2010

  from the chromium Notifications subsystem

  Google chrome did not properly handle an extensions notifications, thus allowing
  remote attackers to cause the application to crash (denial of service) through the
  use of unspecified vectors.

  :note: |
    Commit was made to multiple files all pertaining to the
    notifications subsystem. JohnnyG added a collection system that
    gathered all open notification balloons (which are pop-up 
    notifications that take the form of dialogues on the web page) 
    and closed them thus stopping the application from crashing

  :note: |
    This commit was made by user 'Oshima'. This person is adding
    the notification panel for chromeos here, and they don't properly handle
    closing all the balloons. In his commit message, he states that he had to
    remove some animation code because a part of the browser no longer understood
    how to render its view, and that he 'needs to think a bit more to find out how
    to deal with this'. It seems that the animation code somehow played a role in the collection
    process of the balloons. He also states that it uses an existing balloon collection,
    and that another one may be needed for chromeos. It is clear now that balloon
    collection was not handled properly and required a fix later on.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer:  |
    a single unit test was added to ensure this fix worked
      virtual void RemoveAll() {} <- this was the subsequent change to
      the balloon_controller_unittest.mm file

  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    User 'eroman' encountered a crash with chrome and opened up a bug report with his
    crash log. Other users struggled to recreate these issues at first, before figuring out that
    user 'eroman' had a new version of chrome installed, and there had likely been a regression in
    the notification subsystem.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"

  name: Notifications
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    After the VCC, the bug report was opened up. This led to people asking questions,
    uncovering the versions this bug occurs in. JohnnyG reports that he is looking into
    the situation. Numerous changes occur within the notification subsystem regarding
    the tracking and closing of balloon windows. It is eventually discovered that a race
    condition is causing the window to try and close out twice, and throws an error after
    trying to close a window that is already closed. JohnnyG creates the patch by rounding
    up all stray balloons in the chromeo notifications and closing them individually.

  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      Defense in depth applies here because there were multiple layers of the
      system that needed to change in order to fix this issue. Commits were made in
      about 10 different files, all to collect balloons and properly close them. This
      shows the complexity of the system and the measures that were taken to ensure that
      there are numerous layers that work together in a single moving piece.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability is a result of chrome not properly handling extensions
    notification, allowing remote attackers to cause a system crash. The root
    of this problem could be found in the notifications subsystem. Generally,
    when you have something open in your code, when you finish using it, it is
    important to properly collect and close anything that is left. The issue
    that occured here is that the notification 'balloons' were not properly
    collected before attempting to close them. This led to a race condition
    that happened on shut down. The browser would stop all rendering and force
    windows to close. The code in the notifications subsystem would then detect
    the renderer being shut down as well, and attempt to close the window a
    second time. The fix was introduced by properly collecting all notification
    balloons on shut down, and closing all of those first. This way, there is
    nothing left to try and close the window a second time after the window
    already shuts down. This looks like a proper fix, and addresses the issue
    at multiple points in the system.
