description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  This issue was reported on Oct. 5 2010 by chromium user 'Eroman', and fixed by
  user 'johnnyg' on Dec. 1 2010

  from the chromium Notifications subsystem

  Google chrome did not properly handle and extensions notifications, thus allowing
  remote attackers to cause the application to crash (denial of service) through the
  use of unspecified vectors

  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- :commit: ad085262f5203816bd8949720e3df9aba9147b4e
  :note: commit was made to multiple files all pertaining to the
  notifications subsystem. JohnnyG added a collection system that
  gathered all open notification balloons and closed them thus stopping
  the application from crashing
vccs:
- :commit: 2e5cc5f3deae4aa459b8d5f9188c7cf766b7c08f
  :note: This commit was made by user 'Oshima'. This person is adding
  the notification panel for chromeos here, and they don't properly handle
  closing all the balloons. In his commit message, he states that he had to
  remove some animation code because a part of the browser no longer understood
  how to render its view, and that he 'needs to think a bit more to find out how
  to deal with this'. He also states that it uses an existing balloon colleciton,
  and that another one may be needed for chromeos. It is clear now that balloon
  collection was not handled properly and required a fix later on.

  answer:  There is one single unit test involved in this fix
  code: in 'balloon_controller_unittest.mm' a single line was added to test changes

                    virtual void RemoveAll() {}
  fix: This test was added to an existing suite of tests on balloon notification
  handling

  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: User 'eroman' encountered a crash with chrome and opened up a bug report with his
  crash log. Other users struggled to recreate these issues at first, before figuring out that
  user 'eroman' had a new version of chrome installed, and there had likely been a regression in
  the notification subsystem.

  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
    After the VCC, the bug report was opened up. This led to people asking questions,
    uncovering the versions this bug occurs in. JohnnyG reports that he is looking into
    the situation. Numerous changes occur within the notification subsystem regarding
    the tracking and closing of balloon windows. It is eventually discovered that a race
    condition is causing the window to try and close out twice, and throws an error after
    trying to close a window that is already closed. JohnnyG creates the patch by rounding
    up all stray balloons in the chromeo notificaitons and closing them individually.

  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: defense in depth applies here because there were multiple layers of the
    system that needed to change in order to fix this issue. Commits were made in
    about 10 different files, all to collect balloons and properly close them. This
    shows the complexity of the system and the measures that were taken to ensure that
    there are numerous layers that work together in a single moving piece.

  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    this vulnerability is a result of chrome not properly handling extensions
    notification, allowing remote attackers to cause a system crash. The root
    of this problem could be found in the notifications subsystem. Generally,
    when you have something open in your code, when you finish using it, it is
    important to properly collect and close anything that is left. The issue
    that occured here is that the notification 'balloons' were not properly
    collected before attempting to close them. This led to a race condition
    that happened on shut down. The browser would stop all rendering and force
    windows to close. The code in the notifications subsystem would then detect
    the renderer being shut down as well, and attempt to close the window a
    second time. The fix was introduced by properly collecting all notification
    balloons on shut down, and closing all of those first. This way, there is
    nothing left to try and close the window a second time after the window
    already shuts down. This looks like a proper fix, and addresses the issue
    at multiple points in the system.
