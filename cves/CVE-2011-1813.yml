  A piece of data is created on the heap, and there are multiple pointers which 
  can point to this data. While the browser is used, javascript allows certain 
  parts of the webpage to be adopted by others. In this particular case, an 
  iframe is being 'adopted', and the pointer that points to this iframe is not
  being adjusted. The pointer now points to an invalid piece of data which
  crashes the program.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: 
    The bug was found by a google employee when examining a testcase.
    Testcase::
    <script>
    function test()
    {
        var w = window.open("about:blank");
        var f = w.document.adoptNode(document.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[0]);
        w.document.body.appendChild(f);
        w.close();
    }
    </script>>
    <body onload="test()">
    <iframe src="data:text/html,foo">

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: renderer
  name: extension_helper.cc 
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: During the two commits, there are a lot of tests giving the development
    team some trouble. Including numerous memory leaks and plenty of tests that 
    are temporarily turned off. Sometimes not turned on until commits that occur
    much later
  commits:
  - commit: 906e7970a1d28bee01491d93677b05f1c25a34f0 
    note: Suppress a couple of layout tests before V8 change is rolled 
  - commit: 2526eff06d3302c78f921731ace250ff2ad788f2 
    note: Temorary suppress two tests.
  - commit: 2564b5df1c07c233e172964be7966029d9d45c3d
    note : Fixes up the race condition that exists with deleting a file vs watching it.
    The tests created a file and attempted to hook a watcher on it on a separate thread
    but it was deleting it before the thread had a chance to watch it.
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer:  Several commits end up looking like the following
  Valgrind:Suppress a WebKit memory error from the 82579 - 82603 roll.
  Valgrind:Suppress a leak in BrowserProcessImpl::CreateResourceDispatcherHost()
  Valgrind:Suppress another leak variant in UserStyleSheetWatcher.
  
  That, coupled with what you see in the previous answer makes me think that the team was
  trying to push out a lot of new code to their V8 engine, and their tests along with their
  code was leaking lots of memory. Some of the tests were getting out of date with the new
  code they were pushing, and as a result, they ended up temporarily disabling some tests
  allowing bugs to slip through that wouldn't be discovered until much later.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: These programmers are valuing new code being pushed as what seems
    like an effort to meet a deadline to push some new code either to a stable
    or a development branch. As a result they are having trouble where their
    code is becoming out of date with what their test cases are supposed to catch.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: 
  The developers should have written better comments so that maintainers and 
  other developers can catch where pointers are pointing to, and be able to tell
  when a pointer is left dangling. It's quite difficult when one is writing C++
  code of this complexity, especially in the case where pointers are being passed
  around as a result of javascript code.
  I have a feeling Valgrind, or another internal test should be able to look for data
  on the heap that has pointers to it, and should check for when that data is freed if there
  are any pointers that could be in danger of growing stale.
  Also it seems like there was a test that might have been enabled at some point that
  ended up catching the crash, perhaps disabled in another commit before the VCC and 
  not reenabled until after, although I couldn't find out which commit did so.
