  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: Due to some issues integrating with Windows, Chrome provides an 
  incorrect handle for the rendering process. This copies a full privilege handle
  for the browser into the sandboxed process, effectively shutting off the sandbox.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: In the VCC, there was mention of some 'browser' tests that were claimed
    to cover this new code, but it sounds more like they didn't want to or didn't 
    have time to write new tests. No new tests were added despite a number of new 
    classes being created.
  code: true
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: A volunteer tester ran a script that crashed his browser when it erased their
    history. After checking in the logs, they discovered this error message, 
    "Check failed !(basic_info.GrantedAccess & kDangerousMask). You are attempting to 
    duplicate a privileged handle into a sandboxed process. Please use the sandbox::BrokerDuplicateHandle API
    or contact security@chromium.org for assistance."

  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Based on the bug forum posts and files affected
  name: IPC
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:  The team had issues with windows support
  commits:
  - commit: f720a0f065b13399905030fb959d9c14acda2c99
    note: 'They had other issues with Windows where the operating system provided them with incorrect values that duplicated IPC calls.'

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: A large portion of development went toward supporting a new OS version they released
  events:
  - name: Windows 8 release

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: 
  least_privilege:
    applies: true
    note: Even in the case of an error or crash, the privileges of the handlers should not carry over into a sandbox. The sandboxed process should have the least privilege it needs and stay that way.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: I think the testing surrounding this vulnerability was lacking. From
    what I can tell, it seems as though they had some tests, but this issue was 
    specific to the Windows operating system and it is possible the team was not 
    running these tests on a variety of platforms. This bug was introduced from lazy
    practices by the developers and it wasn't caught because the testing was not 
    exhaustive. A simple addition to the if statement was all it took to mitigate 
    this, so if they had spent more time testing and analyzing the IPC module, they
    would have known to check for the INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.
