description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There is a double free vulnerability in libxml2 2.7.8 and other version as used in gogole chrome before 8.0.552.215.

  Double free vulnerability is a common memory corruption error when developers free the same memory location twice by calling free() on the same
   allocated memory. 

   This vulnerability may allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibily have unspecified other impact relate to the Xpath in this case.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    The fix did not involve automated tests.
    It appears that there is a unit test for the orginal code
  code: true
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave this part blank.
  answer: |
    The vulnerability was discovered by a user and he reported it to the dev team. 
    There was an instruction to reproduce the vulnerability in multiple version of chrome
  date: Nov 17 2010
  automated: true
  google: false
  contest: nil
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
  answer: This is XML Path language implementation in to address part of an XML document. It was desinged to be used by both XSLT and XPointer
  name: XML Xpath
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 681c85692a6421e1f288c329f80dcee25355dd7b
    note:   |
      Refactoring the project was performed by moved all upstream code into a src/ subdirectory.
      This helps keep all patches, build files, and metadata separate.
  - commit: 6999dc89b49b7424f222e6888955d08efce52dde
    note: remove non working functions on os object and d8 window. i
major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: I did not observe any major events during this time

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      The fix for this vulnerability involved putting an if statement to check on context object. 
      The developers plan to avoid to catch one of the few case to free the same memory twice.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Double free vulnerability is a common memory corruption error if the developers don't write a proper check case before they free memory
    In this case, the coding mistakes is the main reason that lead to this vulnerability. 
    The developer shall put some if statement to check an object before he free the object. The file contains more than ten thousands line of code, so it is neccessary to keep track of the process of using a new object and free an old object
    I believe that the vulnerability was fixed correctly.
