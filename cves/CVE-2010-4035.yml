announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: '2010-10-21 15:00:04.737000000 -04:00'
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: "There was a bug in the autofill and translation features which could
  allow attackers\nto cause the application to crash remotely, therefore introducing
  a \ndenial of service vulnerability. This crash is caused by accessing a pointer\nafter
  it was freed. The reason this was possible is because of the way the chrome team\nwas
  using a scoped pointer for management of an 'infobar' delegate pointer. Scoped pointers\nhave
  automatic memory management, which seems to have cleaned up the pointer while it
  was\nstill in use.\n"

fixes:

  :note: |
    The fix involved being more careful with handling of pointers, there
    ended up being a pointer that was referenced after it was freed, causing
    the crash. They ended up doing this by replacing the scoped pointer with a
    normal pointer for the infobar delegate. This required the chrome team
    to handle memory management on their own, so that it wouldn't get unallocated
    too early.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    The original code was not unit tested and the problem was not found through
    unit testing. In fact, it took the chromium team a while to find a way to deterministically
    reproduce the problem. After finding a way to reproduce the problem, some unit testing was
    added in the translation subsystem, but not the credit card autofill system.
  code: false
  fix: true
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    The bug was discovered by human testing on the autofill feature for credit
    cards and was reported by a member of the chromium team.
  date: 2010-07-27
  automated: false
  google: true
  contest: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: 'The mistake was inside the autofill and translation subsystems.

'
  name: autofill, translate
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
  - commit: dfa7be2725cd81ffd8f11a6b902159cde7db4957
    note: |
      An initial attempt at fixing the bug which didn't work. Added a condition which
      would log when the pointer for tab delegate was null. This probably did help
      discover a more deterministic way to reproduce the error.
  - commit: d139a130adb6b17921e1a71da21fcc8fc5c73722
    note: 'Added new languages to translation system.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: Throughout the life of this bug, the translation subsystem saw the addition
    of many features.
  events:
  - name: New languages added to translation system.
    date: 2010-07-18
  - name: Switched out translation manager
    date: 2010-07-01
  - name: Added ability to translate page with unknown language based on metadata
    date: 2010-04-20
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: "This problem seems to be caused by a coding mistake. For both the subsystems\nthat
    the vulnerability existed in, the problem involved incorrect usage of \npointers.
    Low level languages where memory management has to be done manually\ncan be tricky,
    it would be shocking if no such errors ever occurred inside a\nproject as large
    as chrome. What's interesting about this bug is the fact that\nautomatically managed
    pointers (which are supposed to make things easier) actually\ncaused the bug to
    happen. Because of this, the team decided to do their own memory\nmanagement,
    which they could have more explicit control over.\n"
