CVE: CVE-2013-2858
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: [416]
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curation_level: 1
announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
announced: 2013-06-04
description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  There is an vulnerability in versions of Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.110 where
  the HTML5 implementation of audio would try to use memory immediately after
  it had been freed. This would allow attackers to crash a user's current tab of Google
  Chrome.

  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here

  :note: |
    Fixed on 2013-05-14 by crogers. What he did was add a check to make sure
    that the webaudio source hadn't changed. They also added a mutex that would
    track its memory consumption and stop it from trying to use it immediately
    after it had been freed.
vccs:
- :commit: 5189b4c748c173f48f0f82323ec27d7c2ef42d4a
  :note: |
    Added 2011-08-18 by crogers. This was when the webaudio subsystem was implemented
    into the system, they used basic checks and assert statements which is what allowed the vulenrability to occur.
upvotes_instructions: |
  For the first round, ignore this upvotes number.

  For the second round of reviewing, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    It seems that this file did not have any units tests involved with this vulenrability.
    In the original vcc I found assert statements, but those were absent in the fix commit.

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    A user discovered this vulnerability by creating an <audio> element
    and audio handler function. When they changed the audio src attribute by
    clearing it and then reassigning it, they discovered that it would crash the
    Google Chrome tab that this action was done in.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    This is in the Webkit subsystem, specifically the web media
    player client implementation file.
  name: /third_party/WebKit/Source/Webkit/chromium/src
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    The reason I find this commit so interesting is beacuse of how out of no
    where it is when looking through the git log. In between the multiple commits
    updating the webkit subsystem this entire library was just removed from the project.
    This was a good idea for them to do because if they left this unused library in the code base, it could have led to more
    vulnerabilities.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    There were no major events to happen in between the VCC and the fix. The only
    things to happen were updates to the WebKit subsystem to flesh it out more
    with support for graphics and how it handles media.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      This vulnerability was caused by their usage of the WebKit library. If they didn't use this library
      for all of their webmedia player uses they could have avoided the memory issue crashing the tab.

    note: |
      This was only found by changing the source file for an audio element programatically.
      This vulnerability would have never been found if the source attribute was secured and no user could change it
      in a malicious way, such as a XSS attack to change the source.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I believe that this was a design mistake on the part of the team, after looking at the fix and the vcc and what was changed.
    It seems as if the team never thought that someone would try to programatically change the audio source, so they had to redesign the client implementation of the web media player to
    include a mutex and other states to make sure that the memory is not being used immediately after it is freed.
