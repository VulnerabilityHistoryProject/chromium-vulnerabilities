CVE: CVE-2013-0841
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: [20,129]
curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE date. A good
  source for this is Chrome's Stable Release Channel
  (https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/).
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  In the content-blocking funtionality of Google Chrome, there is a
  vulnerability where an array index is not checked. Content blocking
  is important to protect the user from unsafe scripts. 
  
  This vulnerability could potentially allow remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (DoS). It could also cause the disclosure of information and
  unauthorized modification of data. This array is responsible for logging the
  type of content settings accessed.
  
  The fix for this vulnerability is to prevent the array index from going lower
  than zero or higher than the size of the array.

fixes:
- :commit: 85f2fcc7b577362dd1def5895d60ea70d6e6b8d0
  :note: |
    The fix was exiting the function if the index was out of bounds.
vccs:
- :commit: 9fb83e856fc12168151094df31e57177e4844417
  :note: |
    This VCC used the index in the array without checking to see if it was
    within bounds.
- :commit: 55126134af52fe0f6a426f0f7ccfeeb8cf2c9f28
  :note: |
    This VCC created the function where the array and index was used, and 
    also did not check to see if it was within bounds.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module.

    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  answer: |
    There is no evidence of automated unit tests for this vulnerability. 
  code: false
  fix: false
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "google" flag can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered by a user and reported to the development team.
    The vulnerability could be shown when a patch put a multiplier on the index. Then
    if the user navigated to www.pandora.com, the browser crashed. This vulnerability
    is not specific to www.pandora.com, but www.pandora.com was able to create the 
    right environment to envoke this crash.

  contest: 
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    This was in the browser subsystem. This is because it is within the chrome directory.
  name: browser
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section by explaining
    what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There was an interesting commit that made the the content settings not depend on an exact
    set of content types. This commit may explain how the vulnerability may have taken place.
    By deviating from a set number of types, it opened the array up to indexing errors.

major_events:
  question: |
    Please record any major events you found in the history of this
    vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
    changed? Did the team change?

    The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
    we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability appeared when the team was moving content settings code out of the 
    content module.
  events:
  - name: The team is moving content settings out of the content module. 
    date: 2011-5-13
  - name: The team finishes moving content settings out of the content module

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was introduced during the implementation phase of development.
    I believe this vulnerability was the result of a coding mistake, but it could be
    the result of a design mistake as well. Due to the relatively simple nature of
    this vulnerability I believe that it could have simply been a mistake done by the
    programmer. Not properly checking array indexing is something can be easily
    forgotten. If input validation was not part of the design, then this is a design
    mistake as well. In order to prevent this vulnerability going forward, it must be 
    remembered that array indexes should always be validated before use. The chromium
    should also consider improving their unit testing plan. Array indexing is a
    vulnerability that can usually be caught during unit testing.
